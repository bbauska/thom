<h1>The GOP's New Civil War Against America Isn’t With Bullets — It’s With Ballots</h1>

<h4><i>Why 51 Texas lawmakers fled the State to stop a power grab, and what it means for us all…</i></h4>

The Republican motto — since Nixon sabotaged LBJ‘s Vietnam peace negotiations and Reagan 
blew up Carter’s deal to get the Iranian hostages back — has been: “If you can’t win, 
cheat.”

As Republicans rush to redistrict/gerrymander Texas, if enough Dems leave town there 
won’t be a quorum so the redistricting can’t happen. Which is why Texas Attorney 
General Ken Paxton was threatening to could lock up Democratic lawmakers to prevent 
them from leaving the state.

Governor Abbott thought he had a pretty slick plan; have Texas: Republicans refuse to 
consider legislation funding aid to the people stricken by the recent disastrous, 
climate-change-fueled floods until after the state had been more severely gerrymandered. 
Because of massive FEMA cuts, those people are pretty desperate.

Calling his bluff yesterday, Democrats fled the state to Illinois, where Governor JB 
Pritzker offered sanctuary to the 51 Texas legislators in need of it. Texas Democratic 
Caucus Chair Gene Wu said:
<blockquote>
“Governor Abbott has turned the victims of a historic tragedy into political hostages in 
his submission to Donald Trump. He is using an intentionally racist map to steal the 
voices of millions of Black and Latino Texans, all to execute a corrupt political deal. 
Apathy is complicity, and we will not be complicit in the silencing of hard-working 
communities who have spent decades fighting for the power that Trump wants to steal.”
</blockquote>

But that’s just the smallest tip of the iceberg of election rigging that Trumpy 
Republicans are pushing all across the country. Sadly, because Democrats are not 
making a big deal nor being theatrical about it, the media is paying almost no 
attention to the number one way Republicans are rigging the next two elections.

If the Republican Party insists on invoking Abraham Lincoln’s name, they might want to 
pause and read something the man actually said. “The ballot is stronger than the 
bullet,” Lincoln famously declared a principle he fought an actual civil war to uphold. 
But today, the party that claims him as its founder is waging a different kind of war; 
not against slavery, but against democracy itself.

This time, their biggest weapon isn’t the bullet or even gerrymandering: it’s the purge.

From Georgia to New Jersey, from Congress to the courts, the GOP is in the middle of an 
all-out assault on the very foundation of American self-governance: the vote. And unlike 
Trump’s attempts to steal the 2020 election in full public view, this campaign is 
quieter, more technical, and far even more destructive.

In a breathtaking abuse of power, Trump’s Department of Justice — just eight days after 
he took the oath of office — began dismantling the legal safeguards meant to protect 
voters from being purged from the rolls.

Before Trump’s handpicked crony Pam Bondi — the former Florida AG who ignored Jeffrey 
Epstein for years — was even confirmed, Trump’s DOJ had already dropped a lawsuit 
challenging Virginia’s last-minute voter purge throwing massive numbers of people off 
the voting rolls. Then came Alabama. Then Kentucky.

This wasn’t just some small policy change; it was a purge. And these early moves were 
just the opening salvo.

By spring, Trump’s captive DOJ wasn’t even pretending anymore. It was openly threatening 
lawsuits and demanding statewide voter rolls under the flimsy pretext of “citizenship 
verification,” code for intimidating states into purging voters and making registration 
harder. At least 16 states have already been contacted, including by federal 
prosecutors, a deeply disturbing move, considering the DOJ has no legal role in 
administering elections.

The message couldn’t be clearer: this is about building the infrastructure to 
interfere with future elections, just as Trump demanded in 2020 before career 
DOJ officials stopped him.

Now, under his second regime, he’s making sure there’s no one left to say no. The 
hijacking of the DOJ is not just corrupt: it’s a full-scale assault on democracy, 
laying the legal groundwork to steal 2026 and 2028 in plain sight.

This is just one aspect of how the modern Republican Party has made voter suppression 
a central plank of its political strategy, and they’re counting on you not to notice 
until it’s too late.

To start with Georgia, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is often held up by 
mainstream media as the “reasonable Republican” who stood up to Trump’s plot to 
overturn the 2020 election. But scratch beneath that surface and you’ll find a 
man fully on board with the GOP’s long-standing war on voting rights.

This month, Raffensperger announced that his office is canceling the voter 
registrations of nearly 500,000 Georgians, one of the largest such purges in 
American history.

Half a million people, gone from the rolls with a bureaucratic keystroke in a 
state Trump only won by 115,100 in 2024 and lost by a bit over 11,000 in 2020.

That’s not protecting democracy. That’s blowing a hole in the side of the ship 
and hoping nobody notices the water pouring in.

Raffensperger claims this is about “cleaning” the voter rolls. But Greg Palast, 
who’s spent decades investigating voter suppression, showed years ago that this 
kind of mass purge disproportionately targets young people, people of color, and 
low-income Americans, the exact same groups that tend to vote Democratic.

In fact, in 2018, Palast uncovered that 340,134 voters were wrongly removed from 
Georgia’s rolls: people who hadn’t moved or died or become ineligible, but were 
still wiped out under the excuse of “list maintenance.” That purge likely cost 
Stacey Abrams the governor’s race. In 2020, it happened again and Trump may have 
lost anyway, but voter suppression certainly made it close.

Then BBC/Rolling Stone/Guardian reporter Greg Palast told us the truth about the 
2024 election after going through the roughly 4 million voters who were purged 
just before that contest with the piece he wrote for this newsletter titled: 
“TRUMP LOST. Vote Suppression Won”:

“Trump lost. That is, if all legal voters were allowed to vote, if all legal 
ballots were counted, Trump would have lost the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, 
Pennsylvania and Georgia. Vice-President Kamala Harris would have won the 
Presidency with 286 electoral votes.

<blockquote>
“And, if not for the mass purge of voters of color, if not for the mass 
disqualification of provisional and mail-in ballots, if not for the new mass 
“vigilante” challenges in swing states, Harris would have gained at least 
another 3,565,000 votes, topping Trump’s official popular vote tally by 1.2 
million.”
</blockquote>
Harris didn’t lose to Trump. She lost to the vote suppressors and the Democratic 
Party’s unwillingness to publicly raise a fuss about it or fight back by purging 
Republican voters in Blue states (a tactic that former Congressional Progressive 
Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Pocan endorsed on my program last Friday).

Now, Raffensperger (pronounced “Raff-ens-purger”) wants to go even further. He wrote to 
Congress this month urging them to repeal the National Voter Registration Act, the 1993 
“Motor Voter” law that explicitly says we have a “right to vote” and prevents states 
from aggressively purging voters without due process.

He wants to make it easier for Republican-controlled states to wipe voters off the 
rolls without having to follow even the most minimal of those pesky federal rules.

This is not an isolated case. This is part of a larger GOP strategy to quietly dismantle 
the machinery of voting rights under the guise of “election integrity.”

In Congress, Republicans recently held a hearing stacked with anti-voting extremists who 
pushed for weakening federal voting laws and expanding purges. And in New Jersey — not 
even a swing state — the RNC just filed a lawsuit demanding access to the state’s voter 
rolls and voting machine records, another front in their broader war to “find” 
nonexistent voter fraud and justify new crackdowns.

Why New Jersey? Because there’s a governor’s race this fall, and Republicans are 
desperate for a win they can spin into momentum.

This isn’t just about fraud; it’s also about fear. They know their policies are 
unpopular. They know the American majority doesn’t want forced birth, dirtier air, 
gutted Medicaid, book bans, billionaire tax breaks, the military in our streets, 
and an adjudicated fraudster and bribe-accepting rapist in the White House. So 
instead of changing their platform, they’re changing the rules of the game.

We’ve seen this playbook before. After the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights 
Act in Shelby County v. Holder, Republican-controlled states wasted no time enacting 
new voter ID laws, slashing polling places and drop boxes in Black neighborhoods, 
ending Sunday voting, and purging rolls en masse.

These weren’t reforms or even list-cleaning efforts. These were weapons, and they 
worked and continue to work.

The strategy is simple: create enough barriers to voting that millions of eligible 
Americans either don’t know they’ve been purged, or give up trying to fight their 
way through the red tape.

Even the Department of Justice, now fully politicized, is getting in on the act. 
They’ve reportedly sent letters to states demanding voter information, supposedly 
in search of “illegal voting.”

This is the same phony excuse used by Trump’s disbanded voter fraud commission in 
2017 — which spent millions and didn’t find any voter fraud anywhere in America — 
and it’s just as baseless now as it was then.

But that doesn’t matter. The point is to discourage, intimidate, and overwhelm; to 
make voting feel difficult, risky, or futile.

Marc Elias, one of the few high-powered lawyers still fighting for democracy in the 
courts, put it plainly:
<blockquote>
“Make no mistake: these efforts to make it easier to remove voters from the rolls 
are actively weakening our democracy.”
</blockquote>

He’s right. We are watching, in real time, the intentional hollowing-out of our most 
sacred civic act that’s at the foundation of democracy: voting.

It’s not just that the GOP is unwilling to stand up for voting rights. It’s that 
they’re actively engineering our democracy’s collapse. Trump’s Justice Department 
just demanded voting information from Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, 
Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Oklahoma, New Hampshire, New York, Utah, 
and Wisconsin.

They’re attacking our democracy itself; not openly, not with slogans, but with data 
files, database matching tricks, and lawsuits designed to strip you of your rights 
and your vote before you even realize what’s happened.

Abraham Lincoln said the ballot was stronger than the bullet. Ronald Reagan — a man I 
rarely quote favorably — once called voting “the crown jewel of American liberties.” 
But today’s Republican Party has betrayed both. They have traded Lincoln’s legacy for 
Trump’s lies and turned Reagan’s jewel into a cheap trinket sold off for power.

Thus, the New Civil War the GOP has declared on America is in a way reminiscent of the 
Old South’s Confederacy, although this time it isn’t being fought with bullets; it’s 
with ballots.

The 2025 elections and the 2026 midterms and beyond will be fought not just on the 
campaign trail, but at your county elections office, at your state legislature, and 
in your mailbox.

And if we don’t demand that our Democratic state officials gerrymander, purge, 
publicize, litigate, and employ every other legal method to counter this GOP 
assault on democracy, we may wake up one day soon and find that, like in Russia 
and Hungary, the ballot has become meaningless.

Our ancestors bled for the right to vote and have it count. Our enemies fear it. 
The only question left is will we — and elected Democrats — demand change loudly 
enough to provoke action before it’s too late?

The Next Time Some Idiot Tries to Tell You the GOP is “The Party of Business”
As predictably as the sun rises, every Sunday a commentator or politician on one of the 
Sunday political talk shows says — without being challenged —that the Republican Party 
understands and supports business better than Democrats. The weekend as I’m writing this 
chapter, it was CNN’s turn.

All my life, the media has told us that the GOP is the “party of business.”

It may have once been true under Eisenhower when I was a very young child, but today 
it’s a lie — and has been so in a huge way since the neoliberal Reagan Revolution.

Republicans kill economies; Democrats rescue and build them.

Between 1933 and 2020 there were 14 American presidents, 7 Democratic and 7 Republican.

The economy during this time grew at an average rate of 4.6% under the Democratic 
presidents, but only an anemic 2.4% under Republican presidents.[clxxvi] For example, 
the economy has grown three times faster under Biden than under Trump.[clxxvii]

Ten of the past 11 recessions began under Republican presidents. The last three 
Democratic presidents have seen over 50 million jobs created on their watch; the 
number for the last three Republican presidents is zero. Actually, it’s less than 
zero.[clxxviii]

Republican presidents have exploded the national debt, while the only balanced 
budgets out of the past 60 years have been presented by Democratic presidents 
Carter, Clinton, and Obama.[clxxix] [clxxx]

Bill Clinton left George W. Bush a $128 billion surplus (after 4 consecutive years 
of budget surpluses): Bush immediately squandered it with a massive tax cut for 
billionaires and two criminal wars.[clxxxi]

Just in 2022, President Biden decreased federal spending by $550 billion and reduced 
the deficit by $1.4 trillion — the largest one-year deficit drop in American history — 
all while creating five times more jobs in 2 years than the last three Republican 
presidents combined.[clxxxii] [clxxxiii]

If not for the Reagan, Bush, and Trump tax cuts for billionaires and the two wars 
George W. Bush lied us into, our national debt could today be close to zero instead 
of over $30 trillion.[clxxxiv]

To add injury to insult, Republicans destroy small businesses while propping up 
giant monopolies.

The core of American business and thus the livelihood of American communities 
before Reagan was small- and medium-sized companies.

Small- and medium-sized companies built America and brought us the American middle 
class, the first and largest middle class in the world. But in 1983, when Reagan 
ordered the DOJ, FTC, and SEC to stop enforcing anti-trust laws dating back to the 
Sherman Act of 1890, giant corporations began a relentless campaign to destroy 
locally owned companies.

Strip malls and small-town downtowns that were once mostly home to local retailers 
are now dominated by giant monopolistic national chains. Big Box stores, spreading 
across the country unconstrained since Reagan, have been wiping out small towns and 
rural communities.

One study found, as Reuters reported: “[T]he closer a store was to the Walmart location, 
the greater the likelihood it would close. Persky and his colleagues found that for 
every mile closer to the Walmart, 6 percent more stores closed. Close in around the 
store's location, between 35 and 60 percent of stores closed.”[clxxxv]

For most American businesses and the communities they serve, Republican governance 
has been a disaster since the Reagan 1980s.

But it’s not just business where Republicans work against the little guy; it’s also 
labor. Unions made America — and American business — rich but Republicans hate them 
and have made it nearly impossible to unionize in every Red state in America.

Republican President Dwight Eisenhower ran for re-election in the 1956 election by 
bragging that he’d expanded Social Security across America, and his 1952 election 
was mostly powered by his enthusiastic endorsement of unionization.

At a speech before the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1952, Eisenhower noted 
that the first national legalization of unions in America was signed by Republican 
President Calvin Coolidge, the 1926 Railway Labor Act.[clxxxvi]

“Only a handful of unreconstructed reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of breaking 
unions,” he told the union group now known as the AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest. 
“Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the 
union of their choice.”

Similarly, in September of 1970 President Richard Nixon hosted labor leaders from 
across America, praising the movement. As The New York Times noted on September 8, 
1970:

“When the ‘great issue’ has been whether to support the President and to meet the 
nation’s responsibilities ‘for defending and protecting the forces of freedom in 
the world,’ he said, ‘American labor has never been found wanting. It has always 
been the first in war and in peace.’”[clxxxvii]

As a result of combined Democratic and Republican support of unions, by Reagan’s 
election in 1980 about two-thirds of all American workers had a union job or its 
equivalent, with great pay, benefits, and retirement plans, because a third of 
workers were union members and that set the pay and benefits floor for the non-union 
employers to compete for another third of workers.

But, following Nixon putting Lewis Powell on the Supreme Court in 1971, the GOP began 
to adopt the positions in the Powell Memo, which included gutting labor unions so the 
morbidly rich could become even richer.

Their rationale was that giving workers a say in the workplace had “destabilized” 
America, a point first made in 1951 by Russell Kirk in his book The Conservative 
Mind that I detailed in my book The Hidden History of American Oligarchy.[clxxxviii]

President Reagan, however, declared war on organized labor with his attack on the 
PATCO union. Ever since, the GOP has been fighting efforts to expand unionization.

Combined with Reagan’s massive tax cuts for billionaires and giant corporations, 
this loss of union representation has led to a $50 trillion transfer of wealth 
from the homes and retirement accounts of working-class people straight into the 
money bins of the morbidly rich.

Instead of two-thirds of Americans having a middle-class lifestyle like in 1980, 
today that number is down to around 45 percent of us. As a result, both poverty 
and homelessness have exploded across the land. And poor and homeless people can’t 
afford to support a strong economy — and thus American business — the way a 
prosperous middle class can.

To make things even worse, Republicans fight regulations that save American 
lives and protect business.
<blockquote>
Dwight Eisenhower created the Small Business Administration to “aid, counsel, assist, 
and protect insofar as is possible the interests of small-business concerns.”[clxxxix]
</blockquote>
He signed a massive expansion of Social Security to take the pension/retirement onus 
off small- and medium-sized employers, increased the minimum wage so a prospering 
working class could purchase the products of American manufacturers, and built low-income 
housing across the nation to end the homeless “hobo” problem left over from the Republican 
Great Depression.[cxc]

Eisenhower created from scratch the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to 
build a healthy and well-educated workforce, while Richard Nixon signed the 
Environmental Protection Agency into law to protect American workers being poisoned 
by toxic pesticides and other chemicals (the agency’s creation was provoked by Rachel 
Carson’s book Silent Spring).[cxci]

Today’s GOP opposes all of these programs and agencies. They only support the largest 
American companies and the richest citizens.

When Trump was president, he rolled back regulation of toxic pesticides known to cause 
brain damage to children, and one of his first official acts in office was to end the 
prohibition on coal mines dumping their toxic waste and tailings into America’s rivers, 
polluting downstream water supplies with cancer-causing chemicals. His administration 
also dismantled more than 100 other rules intended to safeguard our air, water and 
wildlife.[cxcii]

Republicans keep business costs absurdly high to advantage giant companies over 
the little guy.

Healthcare is one clear example. Arguably, the best policy possible for American 
businesses of all sizes is the Medicare For All program promoted for decades by 
progressive Democrats.

Back in 2004, Toyota announced they’d be opening a new factory in North America. 
Three southern US states offered them billions in tax advantages and free land, 
and the Republican governor of Alabama openly bragged about how cheaply his citizens 
would work for the company.

But in the end, in 2005, Toyota announced they’d be building the factory in Ontario, 
Canada because US healthcare costs are nearly twice those of Canada, which has had a 
successful Medicare For All system in place for more than a half-century (as I lay 
out in The Hidden History of American Healthcare: Why Sickness Bankrupts You and Makes 
Others Insanely Rich).[cxciii]

Since then, as Republicans (and a few bought-off Democrats) continue to fight any effort 
to establish a national healthcare or health insurance system, the company has built two 
more North American factories in Canada.[cxciv]

If it wasn’t for Republican obstruction, the factories would’ve been built in the U.S. 
and the jobs would be here.

The simple reality is that Republicans have no coherent plans for the American economy 
beyond more tax cuts for their morbidly rich donors and more deregulation of the very 
largest and most polluting corporations.

To compensate for this deficiency, they push hate against queer people, public school 
teachers, women, and dark-skinned immigrants. Florida’s Republican Governor Ron DeSantis 
went so far as to attack Disney, Florida’s largest employer and source of tax revenues, 
in retaliation for the company’s support of LGBTQ rights.

Republicans have banned thousands of books from public schools and libraries, saturated 
our towns and cities with weapons of war, banned women’s access to reproductive 
healthcare, and packed our courts with judges who are tight with the American Nazi 
movement, the Federalist Society, and/or the John Birch Society.

Not only are these policies and positions bad for America, they’re also destructive 
of most American businesses.

So, the next time some idiot tries to tell you that the GOP is “the party of business,” 
let them know the real facts.

The only businesses Republicans actually support are gun sellers, megachurches, corrupt 
defense contractors, and giant monopolies. And none of those are good for average 
Americans, locally owned businesses, or the US economy.

The GOP’s 60-Year Conspiracy to Kill Our Democracy: None Dare Call It Treason—But I Will
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
It all traces back to billionaire-backed fearmongering in the 1960s—weaponizing panic around socialism and communism to crush unions, cut taxes, and hoard profits...

In Wednesday’s Daily Take here on Hartmann Report, I mentioned Russell Kirk and the origins of today’s hard right GOP. A few people replied with, “Who’s that?” and similar questions; others were incredulous that Republicans actually believed the middle class created by FDR’s New Deal was a bad thing. So, here’s the backstory to what I mentioned.

I was thirteen years old in 1964 when my dad, a Republican activist, gave me a copy of John Stormer’s book “None Dare Call It Treason.” The Goldwater campaign had sent it to him, and its claim that the State Department was filled with communists intent on handing America over to the USSR had his friends buzzing.

Ironically, Stormer’s book and the movement it ignited within the GOP is largely responsible for that party today standing on the precipice of fully endorsing fascism as an alternative to democracy in the US.

And it was started by morbidly rich men (it was all men back then) who wanted to use the threat of a “communist menace” to gut the union movement to increase their own corporate profits and CEO pay.

The founding premise of the modern conservative movement tracks back a generation before 
Stormer’s book to a Republican thought leader named Russell Kirk. He laid it out in his 
1951 book The Conservative Mind: From Burke to Eliot, as I detail in The Hidden History 
of American Oligarchy.

Kirk argued that the middle class was becoming a threat to America; without clearly 
defined classes and power structures — essentially without the morbidly rich in complete 
control of everything — he worried that society would devolve into chaos.

The opening chapter of his book was about Edmund Burke, the Irish conservative who 
wrote, in 1790, that hairdressers and candlemakers should not be allowed to run for 
political office or even to vote:
<blockquote>
“The occupation of a hairdresser or of a working tallow-chandler cannot be a matter 
of honor to any person — to say nothing of a number of other more servile employments. 
Such descriptions of men ought not to suffer oppression from the state; but the state 
suffers oppression if such as they, either individually or collectively, are permitted 
to rule. In this you think you are combating prejudice, but you are at war with nature...”
</blockquote>
Kirk and his followers essentially predicted in 1951 that if today’s “hairdressers and 
working tallow-chandlers” — college students, women, working-class people, and people 
of color — ever got even close to social and political power at the same level as 
wealthy white men, there would essentially be a communist revolution in the US, 
handing us over to Stalin and his Politburo.

(Keep in mind, this was when racial segregation was legal and brutally enforced, the 
voting age was 21, campuses were almost entirely all-male, both abortion and birth 
control were illegal in most states, and women couldn’t open checking accounts or 
get credit cards without a husband’s, brother’s, or father’s signature.)

Throughout the 1950s, Kirk and his warnings of the dangers of an activist middle-
class developed a small following; the most prominent of his proponents were William 
F. Buckley Jr. and Barry Goldwater. Most Republicans, though, considered him a crackpot.

But when the birth-control pill was legalized in 1961 and the Vietnam War heated up a 
few years later, those marginalized groups Kirk had warned his wealthy white male 
followers about began to rise up in protest.

Kids were burning draft cards, women were burning bras, and Martin Luther King Jr. was 
leading a movement for racial justice that the white power structure blamed for American 
cities burning. Gay liberation was also having a moment.

Meanwhile, the Arab Oil Embargoes of the 1970s had lit the flame of inflation, and 
unionized workers were striking all over America for wage increases to keep up with 
the rising cost of living.

Wealthy white conservatives freaked out as the morbidly rich promoted the idea that 
America was experiencing a “moral decline” that could only be fixed by ending the 
union movement and other “liberal” causes that shared the union movements’ populist 
goals.

They became convinced that they were seeing Kirk’s prophecy play out in real time on 
their television screens every night: the “communists” — those uppity racial minorities, 
women who’d forgotten their “rightful place in society,” students who objected to 
Vietnam, unionized workers, and gender minorities — were on the verge of “taking over” 
America.

These five movements all hitting America at the same time got the attention of 
conservatives and Republicans who had previously ignored or even ridiculed Kirk back 
in the 1950s. Suddenly, America’s most powerful and well-known conservative commentators 
(like William F. Buckley Jr.) were telling Republicans that Russell Kirk was, indeed, a 
prophet.

They’d finally found a politically acceptable “hook” to destroy the wealth of working-
class people and transfer trillions into their own money bins: fear of communism and 
a prophesied social decay caused by an activist middle class.

The Republican/Conservative “solution” to the “crisis” these five movements represented 
was put into place in 1981 when Ronald Reagan was sworn into office: the explicit goal 
of the morbidly rich white men funding the so-called Reagan Revolution was to take the 
middle class down a peg to end the protests of the ’60s and ’70s, restore “social 
stability,” and increase corporate profitability.

Their plan was to declare war on labor unions so wages could slide back down again, 
end free college across the nation so students would live in fear rather than be 
willing to protest, and increase the penalties Nixon had already put on drugs so 
they could use those laws against their scapegoats, particularly the hippy antiwar 
protesters and Black people demanding an end to police killings. They also wanted 
to outlaw abortion, to put women “back in their place.”

Thus, Reagan massively cut taxes on rich people and raised taxes on working-class people 
11 times. For example, he put income taxes on Social Security and unemployment payments, 
and put in a mechanism to track and tax tips income, all of which had previously been 
tax-free but were exclusively needed and used by middle-class people.

He ended the tax deductibility of credit-card, car-loan, and student-debt interest, 
overwhelmingly claimed by working-class people. At the same time, he cut the top tax 
bracket for millionaires and billionaires from 74% to 25%. (There were only a handful 
of billionaires in America then, in large part because of previous tax policies; today’s 
democracy-destroying explosion of billionaires followed Reagan’s, Bush’s, and Trump’s 
massive tax cuts on the rich.)

Reagan declared war on labor unions, crushed PATCO in less than a week, and over the 
next decade the result of his war on labor was that union membership went from about 
a third of the American workforce when he came into office to around 10% at the end 
of the Reagan/Bush presidencies. It’s just now beginning to recover from its low of 
6% of the private workforce.

He and Bush also husbanded the moribund 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades 
(GATT, which let Clinton help create the WTO) and negotiated NAFTA, which Clinton signed 
and thus opened a floodgate for American companies to move manufacturing overseas, 
leaving American workers underemployed while radically cutting corporate labor costs 
and union membership.

And, sure enough, Reagan’s War on Labor cut average inflation-adjusted minimum and 
median wages by more, over a couple of decades, than anybody had seen since the 
Republican Great Depression of the 1920s and ’30s.

The billionaire’s investment in taking the middle-class down a peg was paying off 
by orders of magnitude.

Had Reagan not destroyed the nation’s unions, the median American income today would 
be well over $100,000 a year, minimum-wage households would have a family income of 
$86,000, and a single wage-earner would still be able to buy a house, a car, send 
the kids to college, and have a decent retirement (as my dad did, working a union 
job for 35 years in a tool-and-die shop).

Instead, CEOs today keep all that money for themselves and their investors.

And Reagan’s War on Colleges jacked up the cost of education so high that an entire 
generation is today saddled with more than $1.5 trillion in student debt: as predicted, 
many aren’t willing to jeopardize it all by “acting up” on campuses.

The key to selling this campaign of impoverishment to the American people to help out 
the billionaire class was the idea that the US shouldn’t protect the rights of workers, 
subsidize education, grant women equal rights, or enforce Civil Rights laws because, 
conservatives said, all of those things were aspects of “socialism.” And if America 
embraced socialism, we may as well be ruled by the Soviet Union.

As Reagan told us in his first inaugural, government “socialist” programs were not 
the solution to our problems, but instead were the problem itself.

He ridiculed the formerly-noble idea of service to one’s country and joked that there 
were really no good people left in government because if they were smart or competent 
they’d be working in the private sector for a lot more money.

He even told us that the nine most frightening words in the English language were, 
“I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.”

Following Lewis Powell’s 1971 memo, throughout the 1970s and 1980s Republican 
billionaires built a massive infrastructure of think tanks and media outlets to 
promote and amplify Reagan’s message that government supports of any sort for poor 
or working-class people were simply gateway drugs to socialism and, inevitably, 
communism.

It so completely swept America that by the 1990s even President Bill Clinton was 
saying things like, “The era of big government is over,” and “This is the end of 
welfare as we know it.” Limbaugh, Hannity and other right-wing radio talkers were 
getting millions a year in subsidies from billionaire-funded groups like the Heritage 
Foundation. Billionaire-owned Fox “News” today carries on the tradition.

It had been a pretty good scam for the billionaires who owned the GOP and wanted, back 
in the 1950s, to stop the union movement that was forcing them to share their profits 
with their workers.

First, they terrified Americans about communism and socialism, then convinced about 
half of us that those things came straight out of “liberal” social and economic movements.

Unions, feminism, acceptance of the queer community, civil rights, minimum wage 
increases, and even regulation of corporate behavior would, they told us, all lead 
to Soviet-style tyranny.

So, to save America from herself, Reagan gutted the American middle class, 
transferring over $50 trillion in wealth from working class people into the 
money bins of the morbidly rich.

By 2016, Americans were starting to figure out that they’d been screwed — and 
that Hillary Clinton’s husband had been in on it by continuing Reagan’s policies 
and doubling-down on free trade — and were loudly demanding change.

Into this maelstrom walked Donald Trump, proclaiming himself the savior of the 
country. In the GOP primary he pointed out how corrupt his opponents were, 
particularly Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, and destroyed them, one after the other.

For the general election in 2016, he changed his tune and ran on what was traditionally 
a Democratic platform, saying he was going to bring jobs home, end so-called 
“free trade” policies, raise taxes on the rich so much that “my friends won’t talk 
to me anymore,” and make sure every American had free or low-cost healthcare and 
access to an affordable college education.

They were all lies — something Trump had become adept at during his business career — 
but they worked and sucked in disaffected workers who knew they’d been screwed but 
weren’t sure who did it to them or why.

So here we are.

We have an open fascist and apparent friend of authoritarian Russia as president 
after being convicted by a jury of his peers on 34 felony charges, having previously 
been adjudicated as responsible for sexual abuse (the judge called it “rape”) and fraud.

He’s putting into place people and policies that could turn America into an 
authoritarian nation like Russia or Hungary, and apparently wants to re-align 
the United States away from NATO and the EU and toward Russia, China, Iran, 
and North Korea.

We are literally facing the authoritarian future that John Stormer was warning 
us about back in 1964. Only instead of “communists” in the State Department, it’s 
a billionaire president with the avowed goal of ending union rights and locking 
up or using the Army with live ammunition against those who protest his policies.

And it all tracks back to wealthy conservatives funding a project in the 1960s 
to scare Americans about socialism and communism so they could stop the union-
fueled growth of wages that were cutting into their profits.

Perhaps none dare call it treason. But I do.

TRUMP LOST. Vote Suppression Won.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Here are the numbers from investigative reporter Greg Palast...

A guest post by Greg Palast for the Hartmann Report

Trump lost. That is, if all legal voters were allowed to vote, if all legal ballots were 
counted, Trump would have lost the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and 
Georgia. Vice-President Kamala Harris would have won the Presidency with 286 electoral 
votes.

And, if not for the mass purge of voters of color, if not for the mass disqualification 
of provisional and mail-in ballots, if not for the new mass “vigilante” challenges in 
swing states, Harris would have gained at least another 3,565,000 votes, topping 
Trump’s official popular vote tally by 1.2 million.

Stay with me and I’ll give you the means, methods and, most important, the key 
calculations.

But if you’re expecting a sexy story about Elon Musk messing with vote-counting 
software from outer space, sorry, you won’t get that here.

As in Bush v. Gore in 2000 and in too many other miscarriages of Democracy, this 
election was determined by good old “vote suppression,” the polite term we use for 
shafting people of color out of their ballot. We used to call it Jim Crow.

Here are key numbers:

— 4,776,706 voters were wrongly purged from voter rolls according to US Elections 
Assistance Commission data.
— By August of 2024, for the first time since 1946, self-proclaimed “vigilante” 
voter-fraud hunters challenged the rights of 317,886 voters. The NAACP of Georgia 
estimates that by Election Day, the challenges exceeded 200,000 in Georgia alone.
— No fewer than 2,121,000 mail-in ballots were disqualified for minor clerical errors 
(e.g. postage due).
— At least 585,000 ballots cast in-precinct were also disqualified.
— 1,216,000 “provisional” ballots were rejected, not counted.
— 3.24 million new registrations were rejected or not entered on the rolls in time to vote.

If the purges, challenges and ballot rejections were random, it wouldn’t matter. It’s 
anything but random. For example, an audit by the State of Washington found that a Black 
voter was 400% more likely than a white voter to have their mail-in ballot rejected. 
Rejection of Black in-person votes, according to a US Civil Rights Commission study 
in Florida, ran 14.3% or one in seven ballots cast.

There are also the uncountable effects of the explosive growth of voter intimidation 
tactics including the bomb threats that closed 31 polling stations in Atlanta on 
Election Day.

America’s Nasty Little Secret
The nasty little secret of American democracy is that we don’t count all the votes. 
Nor let every citizen vote.

In 2024, especially, after an avalanche of new not-going-to-let-you-vote laws passed in 
almost every red state, the number of citizens Jim Crow’d out of their vote soared into 
the millions. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, since the 2020 election, 
“At least 30 states enacted 78 restrictive laws” to blockade voting. The race-targeted 
laws ran the gamut from shuttering drop boxes in Black-majority cities to, for the first 
time, allowing non-government self-appointed “vote fraud vigilantes” to challenge voters 
by the hundreds of thousands.

Throughout election seasons, The New York Times and NPR and establishment media write 
stories and editorials decrying vote suppression tactics, from new ID requirements to 
new restrictions on mail-in voting. But, notably, the mainstream press never, ever, 
not once, will say that these ugly racist attacks on voters changed the outcome of an 
election.

Question: If these vote suppression laws—notorious example: Georgia’s SB 202—had no 
effect on election outcomes, then why did GOP legislators fight so hard to pass these 
laws? The answer is clear on the Brennan Center’s map of states that passed restrictive 
laws. It’s pretty much Trump’s victory map.


America Goes Postal
Let’s look at just one vote suppression operation in action.

In 2020, during the pandemic, America went postal. More than 43% of us voted by mail.

But it wasn’t easy. Harris County, Texas, home of Houston, tried to mail out ballots 
during the Covid epidemic on the grounds that voters shouldn’t die waiting in lines 
at polling stations. But then, the state’s Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton 
stopped this life-saving measure.

Why wouldn’t this GOP official let Houstonians vote safely? Maybe it’s because Houston 
has the largest number of Black voters of any city in America. Indeed, on Steve Bannon’s 
podcast, Paxton proudly stated, “Had we not done that [stopped Houston from sending out 
ballots], Donald Trump would've lost the election” in Texas. Texas!

Before the 2024 election, prompted by Trump’s evidence-free attack on mail-in ballots 
as inherently fraudulent, 22 states, according to the Brennan Center, imposed “38 new 
restrictions on the ability to vote absentee that were not in place in 2020…likely to 
most affect or already have disproportionately affected voters of color.” You’re 
shocked, right?

Texas’ requirement to add ID numbers to an absentee ballot caused the rejection rate 
to jump from 1% to 12%.

So, here’s the question we need to ask. If restrictions on mail-in balloting swung 
Texas to Trump, how did all these new restrictions affect the outcome of the vote 
in other states?

In 2020, an NPR study found the mail-in ballot rejection rate hit 13.8% during the 
Democratic primaries—a loss of one in seven ballots.

Take Georgia, where the Palast Investigative Fund spent months in on-the-ground 
investigations.

Here are photos of a Georgia voter, career military officer and Pentagon advisor 
Major Gamaliel Turner (Ret), demonstrating for young voters how to fill out an 
absentee ballot, emphasizing that it must be mailed in promptly. He did, seven 
days before the deadline. But we only recently learned that Georgia officials 
disqualified his ballot as received too late.


Major Gamaliel Turner (now retired) about to mail in his absentee ballot. The state 
of Georgia rejected it. (Photo: Palast Investigative Fund 2024.)
In 2008, even before the majority of Democrats began voting by mail, when absentee 
balloting was much rarer, the federal government reported 488,136 mail-in ballots 
were rejected, almost all on picayune grounds (i.e. middle initial on signature 
missing etc.). An MIT study put the number of rejected mail-in ballots at 2.9%.

That’s the low-end of MIT’s estimate of mail-in ballots tossed out. Charles Stewart, 
Distinguished Professor of Political Science, author of the report, notes mail-in 
ballots requested and never received nor returned could raise the total mail-in 
ballot loss rate to 21%.

For 2024, that would total 14.1 million ballots that, effectively, vanished from 
the count.

The “failure to return” ballot was exacerbated in this election by the steep cut 
in ballot drop boxes, a method favored by urban (read, “Democratic”) voters. Black 
voters in Atlanta used ballot drop boxes extensively because they feared, with good 
reason, relying on the Post Office [see Major Turner’s story above].

In response, the Republican Governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, signed SB 202 which 
slashed the number of drop boxes by 75% only in Black-majority counties and locked 
them away at night. These moves slashed mail-in and drop box balloting, used by 
the majority of Democrats in 2020, by nearly 90% in the 2024 race.

Even if deemed “on time,” ballots still face rejection. Marietta, Georgia, first-time 
voter Andrian Consonery Jr. told me his mail-in ballot was rejected because his 
signature supposedly didn’t match that on his registration. (I needn’t add, Consonery 
is Black.) In effect, Consonery was accused of forgery—a federal crime--not by the 
FBI but by self-appointed amateur sleuths. This challenge to mail-in ballots, part 
of a right-wing campaign, has gone viral.


Georgian Adrian Consonery Jr.’s mail-in ballot was challenged because of a false 
claim that his signature was forged. Photo: Zach D. Roberts for the Palast 
Investigative Fund (2024)
In 2020, the federal government reported that 157,477 ballots were rejected for 
supposedly “mis-matched” signatures. That’s quite a crime wave—but without criminals.

And that’s before we get to the dozens of other attacks on voting that were freshly 
minted for the 2024 election, attacks aimed at voters of color.

The crucial statistic is that not everyone’s ballot gets disqualified. One study done 
for the United States Civil Rights Commission found that a Black person, such as Maj. 
Turner, will be 900% more likely to have their mail-in or in-person ballot disqualified 
than a white voter.

Now, let’s do some arithmetic. If we take the lowest end of the MIT ballot rejection 
rate, and only a tenth of the “lost” ballot rate, and then apply it to the number of 
mail-in and drop-box ballots, we can conservatively estimate that 2,121,000 mail-in 
votes went into the electoral dumpster.

Whose ballots? Democrats are 51% more likely than Republicans to vote by mail; and, 
given the racial disparity in ballot rejections, Trump’s swing-state margins begin 
to look shaky.

The KKK Plan and the New Vigilantes
In 2020, the Palast Investigative Fund uncovered a whole new way to bring Jim Crow 
back to life: challenges to a citizen’s right to vote by a posse of self-proclaimed 
vote-fraud hunters.

Four years ago, the GOP took this new suppression method out for a test ride in 
Georgia when 88 Republican operatives—remember, these are not government officials 
— challenged the rights of over180,000 Georgians to have their ballots counted. 
These vigilantes based their scheme on the program originally used by the Ku Klux 
Klan in 1946.

One challenged voter: Major Turner, the same voter whose mail-in ballot was 
disqualified in a later election.

In 2020, the Major’s ballot was challenged by the county Chairman of the Republican 
Party in Southern Georgia, Alton Russell. (Russell likes to dress up as infamous 
vigilante Doc Holliday, with a loaded six-gun in a holster.) In a (polite) 
confrontation we filmed between the Major and Russell, the GOP honcho admitted he 
had no evidence that Maj. Turner, nor any of the 4,000 others he challenged, should 
be denied the right to have their ballots counted.

Note: The Palast Fund contacted a sample of 800 of these challenged voters and found 
that, overwhelmingly, they were Americans of color.

In 2020, this KKK plan, adopted by the Trump organization, proved its value. In that 
election, Trump almost won Georgia, falling short by just 11,779 votes—only because 
local elections officials rejected most of the challenges. But for 2024, the Georgia’s 
Republican-controlled legislature changed the law to make it very difficult for 
officials to deny the challenges.

That emboldened the Trump-supported organization True the Vote to roll out the 
challenge to every swing state. In 2024, True the Vote signed up over 40,000 
volunteer vigilantes. The organization crowed proudly that, by August of 2024, 
they’d already challenged a mind-blowing 317,886 voters in dozens of states. 
By Election Day this November, True the Vote projected it would have challenged 
over two million voters. In addition, Trump’s lawyer, Cleta Mitchell, founded 
Eagle AI to challenge hundreds of thousands more including in swing state 
Pennsylvania.

How many voters ultimately lost their ballots? Almost all voting officials we’ve 
contacted have refused to answer.

Placebo Ballots
Those voters who’d been challenged but mailed in their ballot would be unlikely to 
know their vote had been lost. Others who showed up in person at a poll would be 
told they could not vote on a regular ballot. These voters were sent away or 
forced to vote on a “provisional” ballot.

If you’ve been challenged or find you’ve been purged off the registration rolls, 
you’ll be offered one of these provisional ballots, paper ballots you place in a 
special envelope. Typically, you’ll be promised your registration will be checked 
and then your ballot will be counted. Bullshit. If you’re challenged, unless you 
personally contact or go into your county clerk’s office with ID and proof of 
address, your ballot goes into the electoral dumpster.

A better name for a “provisional” ballot would be “placebo” ballot. You think 
you’ve voted, but chances are, you did not, that is, your ballot wasn’t counted.

Here's an ugly number: According to the US Elections Assistance Commission 
(EAC), in 2016, when 2.5 million provisional ballots were cast, a breathtaking 
42.3% were never counted.

Think about that. Over a million Americans lost their vote — though, notably, 
not one was charged with attempting to vote illegally. And that was in 2016, 
before the vigilante challenges and before millions more had been purged from 
the rolls leading up to the 2024 election.

And here’s the statistic that matters most. Black, Hispanic or Asian-America 
voters are 300% more likely than white voters to be shunted to a “placebo” 
provisional ballot.

The Great Purge and the Poison Postcard
The polite term in government agencies is, “List Maintenance.” It’s best 
known as The Purge—when voters’ registrations are wiped off the rolls. The 
EAC keeps track of The Purge. It’s a big business. For example, before the 
2022 election, when the data was last available, swing state North Carolina 
wiped 392,851 voters off the rolls.

The majority of removals were based on questionable, indeed, shockingly faulty 
information that a voter had moved their residence. I’m not talking about the 
4.9 million voters purged because they’re dead, or eight million others whose 
residential move could be verified, nor those serving time in prison nor those 
ruled too crazy to vote.

I’m talking about a trick that has been perfected by politicians of both parties 
to eliminate voters of the wrong persuasion: the Poison Postcard. Here’s how it 
works: Targeted voters are mailed postcards by state elections officials. (Let’s 
remember, state voting chiefs, “Secretaries of State,” are almost to a one 
partisan hacks.) Voters who don’t sign and return the cards, which look like 
junk mail, will be purged.

The Poison Postcard response rate is close to nothing. In Arizona, according to 
the EAC, just one in ten postcards are returned. And in Georgia, the vote-saving 
response is barely above 1%. And that’s the way our partisan voting officials 
like it.

Were the millions of Americans purged before the 2024 election all fraudsters who 
should lose their right to vote? Direct marketing expert Mark Swedlund told us, 
“This only means that most people, especially young people, the poor and voters 
of color, simply ignore junk mail.”

With the help of Swedlund and the same experts used by Amazon—and believe me, 
Amazon knows exactly where you live--we took a deep dive into two states’ purge 
operations for the ACLU.

The state of Georgia had purged hundreds of thousands from the voter rolls on 
grounds they’d moved from their voting addresses. Our experts, going name by 
name through Georgia’s purge list, working from special data provided us by 
the US Postal Service, identified 198,351 Georgians who had been purged for 
moving had, in fact, not moved an inch from their legal voting address. The 
state’s only evidence these 198,351 voters had moved? They failed to return 
the Poison Postcard.


In 2020, I testified in federal court for the NAACP and RainbowPUSH, presenting our 
expert findings to get those voters, overweighted with minorities and young Georgians, 
back on the rolls. Unfortunately, the Trump’d-up court system now gives huge deference 
to a state’s voting operations, a trend which first took off in 2013 when the US Supreme 
Court defenestrated the Voting Rights Act.

The results have been devastating. According to the EAC data, before the 2024 election, 
4,776,706 registrants were removed nationwide simply because they failed to return the 
postcard.

Also in 2020, the Palast Investigative Fund produced a technical report for Black Voters 
Matter Fund on a proposed purge of 153,779 voters in Wisconsin, a plan pushed by 
Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, a group financed by right-wing billionaires. 
For Black Voters Matter, we brought back our team of location experts who proved, name 
by name, that the proposed purge was wildly riddled with errors.

Notably, we found that the purged was aimed almost exclusively at African-Americans in 
Milwaukee and at students in Madison. The non-partisan Elections Board agreed with us, 
allowing those voters to cast ballots, with the result that Biden squeaked by Trump in 
Wisconsin by 20,682 votes. (Note: It was not our intention to elect Biden, but to allow 
the voters, not some Purge’n General, to pick our President.)

Unfortunately, before the 2024 election, the Poison Postcard Purge accelerated. This 
time, a new Elections Board in Wisconsin (10 electoral votes) decided to use the same 
discredited purge list to knock off 166,433 voters which, this time, we could not stop. 
Kamala Harris lost that state by just 29,397 votes. In Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes), 
the Poison Postcards wiped out 360,132 voters, three times Trump’s victory margin.

And before the vote this year, Georgia ramped up the purge, targeting an astonishing 
875,000 voters, earning it the #1 ranking for “election integrity” by the ultra-right-wing 
Heritage Foundation.

I saw the purge in action in Savannah, Georgia, this October, where 900 Savannah voters, 
most of them Black, were challenged by one single “vigilante,” according to voting expert 
Carry Smith. Smith, who wrote her doctoral thesis on wrongful purges in Georgia, was 
herself on the hit list.

And more
We haven’t even touched on other ways that voters of color, college students and urban 
voters have come under attack. These include the rejection of new registrations and 
rejection of in-person votes as “spoiled” (i.e. rejected as unreadable), costing, 
according to the EAC, more than a million votes—rejections which our 25 years of 
investigations have found are way overweighted against the Democratic demographic.

After the 2012 election, I was able to calculate, with cold certainty, that 2,383,587 
new voters had their registrations rejected; 488,136 legitimate absentee ballots were 
disqualified, and so on. In that election, a total of 5,901,814 citizens were blocked 
from voting or had their ballots disqualified. These stats were based on the hard data 
from the EAC which gathers detailed reports from the states.

Today, with new, sophisticated, and well-financed vote suppression operations, the 
number of voters purged and ballots disqualified are clearly far higher than the 
suppression count of 2012. Unfortunately, the EAC won’t release data, if it does at 
all, for at least a year. We’ve put in Open Records requests to the states, but 
today’s officials are stonewalling and slow-walking our requests for the data.

In no other democracy are the vote totals—or, to be clear, the uncounted ballot 
totals—a state secret.

America deserves an answer to this question: Excluding a boost from Jim Crow vote 
suppression games, did Donald Trump win?

From the shockingly huge numbers we’ve discussed here of provisional and mail-in 
ballots disqualified, the postcard purge operation, the vigilante challenges and 
so on, we can say, with reasonable certainty, Trump lost—that is, would have lost 
both the Electoral College and popular vote totals absent suppression.

By how much?

For those who can’t sleep without my best estimate, let me apply the most conservative 
methodology possible, as I would do in a government investigation.

I’ve updated the 2012 suppression numbers with the newest available data. Not 
surprisingly, the suppression number has soared, in part because the number of 
voters has increased by 41.3 million since 2012. But principally, the votes “lost” 
also zoomed upward because of the massive increase in mail-in balloting by Democrats 
since 2012, and crucially, the effect of new Jim Crow voting restrictions. Given a 
minimum two-to-one racial and partisan disparity in voters purged and ballots 
disqualified, the 2024 “suppression factor” is no less than 4.596% of the total vote.

Those familiar with data mining will note that there is some double-counting in the 9 
million voters and their ballots disqualified that I cited at the top of the article. 
In addition, we must recognize that many voters caught up in the purges and challenges 
would have cast their ballot for Trump. Therefore, I’ve conservatively cut in half the 
low end of the range of the calculation of votes suppressed to 2.3% to isolate the 
effect on Trump’s official victory margin.

In other words, vote suppression cost Kamala Harris no fewer than 3,565,000 votes. 
Harris would have topped Trump’s official total by 1.2 million. Most important, this 
2.3% suppression factor undoubtedly cost Harris the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, 
Pennsylvania and Georgia. If not for the wholesale attack on votes and voters, Harris 
would have won the election with 286 Electoral votes.

Tech note from a numbers guy—and Martin Luther King
Until the Elections Assistance Commission gets updated figures from the states next year (and, under Trump, I doubt we will ever get those numbers), 3,565,000 votes lost to Harris is the estimate I would present in my role as a forensic expert in a courtroom as the lowest conceivable suppression factor.

I rarely make a big deal about my own credentials but, since the election, the Web has been flooded by amateur, arithmetic-defying speculation about computer hacking and other unsupported twaddle. Best to stick to hard, verifiable data. And that’s what I do.

For two decades, I was a forensic economist for government agencies including the US Justice Department; taught statistics at Indiana University; provided expert calculations of vote suppression for the ACLU, NAACP, and RainbowPUSH, and won the Global Editors Award for my data journalism on vote suppression measurements for reports done for Al Jazeera, BBC, Rolling Stone and The Guardian. The numbers you get here are exactly what I’d present to a Federal court. In other words, kids, don’t do this at home…calculating the “un-count” requires expertise.

I make this point for another reason: The theory that “Elon Musk messed with the voting machines” is, unconsciously, unintentionally racist. With few exceptions, these silly speculations come from those who simply ignore not just the millions of votes officially reported as suppressed, their theories also ignore the horrifically painful experience of Black people turned away from the polls.

Here is a photo of Jessica Lawrence in tears, moments after her 92-year-old grandmother was tossed out of an Atlanta polling station, into a storm, because she’d been wrongfully purged. Any speculation about the nefarious cause of Trump’s win must not leave out Jessica’s grandma nor the millions of other citizens of color who were wrongly barred from their ballot.

Turner in the film, Vigilantes Inc: America’s New Vote Suppression Hitmen, available without charge on YouTube.]
Now here’s the good news.
We saw that in 2020 when, despite extreme, even felonious actions by Trump supporters to block, challenge and disqualify voters and ballots, the theft by suppression was defeated.

That was the work of voting rights groups challenging these attacks. The work was done in the courts and, more important, in the precincts, re-registering the purged, challenging the challenges, “curing” disqualified ballots.

The road is long but victory is certain. After the 2016 election, the Palast team uncovered a cruel, racist purge program called, “Interstate Crosscheck” that cost nearly a million voters, overwhelmingly minorities, their rights. This motivated the Rev. Jesse Jackson to launch a campaign that successfully shut down Crosscheck. Unquestionably, Joe Biden could not have won in 2020 without the Reverend saving literally hundreds of thousands of votes. The point is, they can’t suppress all the votes all the time.

In other words, Democracy can win, despite the 2.3% suppression headwind.

And that’s our job as Americans: to end the purges, the vigilante challenges, the ballot rejections and the attitude that this is all somehow OK.

Martin Luther King gave us our marching orders in 1965, in words just as important today.

“Let us march on ballot boxes, march on ballot boxes until race-baiters disappear from the political arena. I want to say to the people of America and the nations of the world, that we are not about to turn around. We are on the move now.”

Forensic economist and data journalist Palast covered vote suppression for The Guardian, BBC Television and Rolling Stone. He is the author of New York Times bestsellers on the topic including The Best Democracy Money Can Buy.

Social Security’s Death Warrant Was Just Signed — Are You Ready?
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
America’s safety net is their next profit scheme — and you’re the target…
Thom Hartmann

Tuesday night, Donald Trump stood before the nation and, with the full backing of billionaires like Elon Musk, laid the groundwork for the biggest heist in American history — the rapid, systematic destruction of Social Security, disguised as “reform.”

We saw the formal announcement of it during Trump’s State of the Union address, and the DOGE announcement earlier in the week that 7,000 employees at Social Security are to be immediately laid off — with as many as half of all Social Security employees (an additional 30,000 people) — soon to be on the chopping block.

Republicans and their morbidly rich donors have hated Social Security ever since it was first created in 1935. They’ve called it everything from communism to socialism to a Ponzi scheme.

In fact, it has been the most successful anti-poverty program in the history of America, one now emulated by virtually every democracy in the world.

But the rightwing billionaires hate it for several reasons.

The first and most important reason is that it demonstrates that government can actually work for people and society: That then provides credibility for other government programs that billionaires hate even more, like regulating their pollution, breaking up their monopolies, making their social media platforms less toxic, and preventing them from ripping off average American consumers.

Thus, to get political support for gutting regulatory agencies that keep billionaires and their companies from robbing, deceiving, and poisoning us, they must first convince Americans that government is stupid, clumsy, and essentially evil.

Ronald Reagan began that process when he claimed that government was not the solution to our problems but was, in fact, the cause of our problems. It was a lie then and is a lie now, but the billionaire-owned media loved it and it’s been repeated hundreds of millions of times.

Billionaires also know that for Social Security to survive and prosper, morbidly rich people will eventually have to pay the same percentage of their income into it as bus drivers, carpenters, and people who work at McDonald’s.

Right now, people earning over $176,100 pay absolutely nothing into Social Security once that amount has been covered. To make Social Security solvent for the next 75 years, and even give a small raise to everybody on it, the simple fix is for the rich to just start paying Social Security income on all of their income, rather than only the first $176,100.

The entire solvency and health of Social Security could be cured permanently, in other words, if we simply did away with the “billionaire loophole” in the Social Security tax.

But the idea of having to pay a tax on all their income so that middle class and low income people can retire comfortably fills America’s billionaires with dread and disgust. So much so that not one single Republican publicly supports the idea.

How dare Americans have the temerity, they argue, to demand morbidly rich people help support the existence of an American middle class or help keep orphans and severely disabled people from being thrown out on the streets!

Which is why Elon Musk and his teenage hackers are attacking the Social Security administration and its employees with such gusto.

By firing thousands of employees, their evil plan is to make interacting with Social Security such a difficult and painful process — involving months to make an appointment and hours or even days just to get someone on the telephone — that retired Americans will get angry with the government and begin to listen to Republicans and Wall Street bankers who tell us they should run the system.

(This won’t be limited to Social Security, by the way; as you’re reading these words Trump and Musk are planning to slash 80,000 employees from the Veterans Administration, with a scheme to dump those who served in our military into our private, for-profit hospital and health insurance systems.)

The next step will be to roll out the Social Security version of Medicare Advantage, the privatized version of Medicare that George W. Bush created in 2003. That scam makes hundreds of billions of dollars in profits for giant insurance companies, who then kick some of that profit back to Republican politicians as campaign donations and luxury trips to international resorts.

Advantage programs are notorious for screwing people when they get sick, and for ripping off our government to the tune of billions every year. But every effort at reforming Medicare or stopping the Medicare Advantage providers from denying us care and stealing from our government has been successfully blocked by bought-off Republicans in Congress.

Once Republicans have damaged the staffing of the Social Security Administration so badly that people are screaming about the difficult time they’re having signing up, solving problems or errors, or even getting their checks, rightwing media will begin to promote — with help from GOP politicians and the billionaire Murdoch family’s Fox “News” — people opting out of Social Security and going with a private option that resembles private 401(k)s.

Rumor has it they’ll call it “Social Security Advantage” and, like Medicare Advantage, which is administered for massive profits by the insurance giants, it will be run by giant, trillion-dollar banks out of New York.

While big insurance companies have probably made something close to a trillion dollars in profits out of our tax dollars from Medicare Advantage since George W. Bush rolled out the program, Social Security Advantage could make that profit level look like chump change for the big banks.

And, as an added bonus, billionaires and rightwing media will get to point out how hard it is to deal with the now-crippled Social Security administration and argue that it’s time to relieve them, too, of the regulatory burdens of “big government”: Gut or even kill off the regulatory agencies and make their yachts and private jets even more tax deductible than they already are.

This is why Donald Trump repeated Elon Musk’s lies about 200 year-old people getting Social Security checks and the system being riddled with fraud and waste. In fact, Social Security is one of the most secure and fraud-free programs in American history.

But Tuesday night was just the opening salvo. It took Bush almost 3 years to convince Congress to start the process of privatizing and ultimately destroying Medicare.

Having learned from that process, odds are Trump will try to privatize Social Security within the year.

And he may well get away with it, unless we can wake up enough people to this coming scam and put enough political pressure — particularly on Republicans — to prevent it from happening.

Tag, you’re it.

Why are Red State Citizens Poorer, Less Educated, & Sicker than Blue State Citizens?

We must not confuse statistical probability with some transcendental and utterly compelling force. — Unspiek, Baron Bodissey

One of the enduring mysteries of America is why the citizens of Red states are generally poorer, less educated, and sicker than the citizens of Blue states. To that question, I step up as your hierophant with an answer to this deep mystery that you may not have previously considered.

First, that generalization is broadly true:

— Blue states account for about 71 percent of America’s GDP, whereas Red states only produce 29 percent of our income and wealth.
— The median family income in Blue states is $74,243. In Red states it’s $63,553. Individual states highlight the disparity: New Jersey’s median income is $89,703, while Mississippi’s is $49,111.
— Counties that voted for Biden in 2020 are more diverse, being 35 percent nonwhite compared to 16 percent nonwhite populations in counties that voted for Trump.
— Counties that voted for Biden in 2020 are better educated, with 36 percent of their population having some college education compared to Trump’s counties at 25 percent.
— Residents of Blue states live 2.2 years longer, on average, than residents of Red states.

And, second, it’s undeniably true (and documented with each hotlink below) that Republican-controlled Red states, almost across the board, have higher rates of:

— Spousal abuse
— Obesity
— Smoking
— Teen pregnancy
— Sexually transmitted diseases
— Abortion (at least before Dobbs; now it would be “forced births”)
— Bankruptcies and poverty
— Homicide and suicide
— Infant mortality
— Maternal mortality
— Forcible rape
— Robbery and aggravated assault
— Dropouts from high school
— Divorce
— Contaminated air and water
— Opiate addiction and deaths
— Unskilled workers
— Parasitic infections
— Income and wealth inequality
— Covid deaths and unvaccinated people
— Federal subsidies to states (“Red State Welfare”)
— People on welfare
— Child poverty
— Homelessness
— Spousal murder
— Unemployment
— Deaths from auto accidents
— People living on disability
— Gun deaths

But are all these things happening because Republicans simply hate their citizens and explicitly want high levels of poverty, ignorance, death, and disease? 

Turns out there’s a much simpler answer.

The problem for Red states is that Republicans worship cheap labor, because it drives up profits for the fat-cats who own American businesses — and having a steady and reliable supply of cheap labor to maintain high profits requires widespread poverty, ignorance, death, and disease.

That poverty, of course, brings along with it the long list of social ills above, but Republicans are more than willing to tolerate massive, desperate levels of human suffering to make sure there’s a steady supply of cheap labor. In fact, they intentionally run their states that way to produce those results.

If you have any doubts about this, if that sounds like hyperbole, simply look at the policies the GOP has promoted for the past century:

— Republicans hate unions, because unions raise wages and benefits for workers, shifting them from poverty into the middle class. Once thus empowered, those uppity middle-class people then start to demand “unreasonable” things like overtime pay (Project 2025 would functionally end it), healthcare, paid vacations, paid sick leave, and paid family leave.

— Republicans hate Social Security and have worked to gut, privatize, or outright end it ever since FDR signed it into law in 1935. They do this because elderly workers in poverty are a great source of compliant, cheap labor. Reagan’s changes in Social Security benefits have led to millions of Boomers having to take gigs as greeters, waiters, etc., for low wages; prior to Reagan’s changes in the Cost of Living Adjustments (COLAs) and his raising the retirement age to 67, you could safely retire on Social Security in most parts of America. Now, Republicans want to raise that age to 69 or 70.

— Republicans hate universal or inexpensive healthcare (and real Medicare for the elderly) because having massive medical debt provides a large pool of desperate workers willing to work crappy jobs for pathetic wages to pay it off. It’s why the ten states that refuse to expand Medicaid for low-income workers are all Republican-controlled.  Medical debt is a non-issue in every other developed country in the world, but here in America 79 million people are struggling to pay off doctors’ or hospital bills (7 million of those debtors are elderly, many the victims of the Medicare Advantage scam).

— Republicans hate the minimum wage because it cuts into profits. That’s why the minimum wage in Blue states can be more than twice that of Red states (Washington State is $17/hr versus Texas’ $7.25/hr). When most families are barely earning enough to get by, employers have their pick of distraught, panicked workers willing to work for subsistence wages.

— Republicans hate empowered women because forced pregnancies create more potential workers and unwanted children exacerbate poverty. Thus their 50+ years of opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment and their embrace of abortion bans.

— Republicans promote hatred of racial, religious, and gender minorities because when Americans are at each other’s throats they’re not organizing to throw off the GOP/corporate yoke. It’s hard to remember that the billionaires have stolen fully $50 trillion from the middle class over the past 43 years of the Reagan Revolution when you’re constantly distracted with hysteria about Black Haitians, Brown Mexicans, and trans students who just want to use the damn bathroom.

— Republicans hate education because it’s the main tool for people to lift themselves out of poverty and thus demand higher wages and better benefits. Before the Reagan Revolution, every American who wanted to and could pass the entrance exams could go to college; many universities (like the entire University of California system) were free, and you could pay your tuition at most other colleges like I did in the 1960s working weekends as a dishwasher at Bob’s Big Boy in East Lansing, Michigan and pumping gas at the Esso station across the street. This is also why so many Red states are gutting their public education systems with private school vouchers. Less education, more poverty; more poverty, more cheap labor.

— Republicans hate atheism and embrace a neofascist form of Protestant Christianity and a bizarre, rightwing version of Catholicism that goes by a Latin name because both are hierarchical and male-dominated, just like corporate culture. It’s why the Confederacy was explicitly Christian. “Don’t worry about how much you’re paid, boy, or bother organizing into a union; just keep picking that cotton and you’ll get your reward in heaven when you die.” After all, according to the Bible your fate was preordained “before the foundation of the world,” as was that of your boss, who must have been selected for particular grace by God or he wouldn’t be so rich.

— Republicans hate food stamps, housing supports, aid to women and dependent children, and every other form of what they call “welfare” because these programs slightly reduce the desperation of people who might otherwise be easily forced to work for a pittance.

— Republicans hate environmental protections because they cut into profits; who cares if the lack of them create things like the “Cancer Alley” — which hits children particularly hard — that runs through Texas and Louisiana?

— Republicans hate unemployment insurance because it reduces the privation people can experience when they lose a job. It’s why all the Blue states offer at least 26 weeks of benefits, but Red states often radically reduce that (Florida, North Carolina, Kentucky 12 weeks; Alabama 14 weeks; Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri 16 weeks).

So, the next time somebody asks why people living in Red states have it so rough, just tell them, “It’s all because of the cheap-labor Republicans.”

The New "Over the Top" Secret Plan on How Fascists Could Win in 2024

Here’s what I’m hearing Republicans are planning in the event Joe Biden wins re-election & Democrats hold the Senate and take the House this November…

Back on March 13, 2020 — almost exactly four years ago — I wrote an article that was published at alternet.org laying out how Republicans were then, ten months before January 6th, planning to partially repeat the debacle of the election of 1876 by having Vice President Pence refuse to certify swing state votes and thus throw the election to the House to keep Trump in office, no matter how the election went.

When I published the article ten months before January 6th, I received concerned and even alarmed communications from several Democratic strategists and a few elected officials who basically said they didn’t think there was any way Trump would try such an audacious move and, if he did, he wouldn’t get away with it.

But I was right and that was exactly what Trump had up his sleeve. We saw it play out on January 6th. The only thing that stopped him was Pence’s unwillingness to go along with stealing an election.

Now I’m hearing a new story from those same GOP insiders (as well as other commentators) about Trump’s schemes for 2024. Here’s what I’m hearing Republicans are planning in the event Joe Biden wins re-election and Democrats hold the Senate and take the House this November:

First, Republicans need to make sure they’re in control of the House of Representatives on January 6th, 2025, when the new president will be certified.

To do that, even though Democrats might have won enough seats to take back the House in the 2024 election, Speaker Johnson will refuse to swear into Congress on January 3rd a handful of those Democrats, claiming there are “irregularities” in their elections that must be first investigated.

Consider that Johnson is still refusing to swear in Tom Suozzi (who recently won George Santos’ old seat), something Johnson apparently did to maintain enough Republican-majority votes to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas. (Johnson says they’ll swear him in this coming Thursday, but nobody’s holding their breath.)

Like Mitch McConnell withholding Merrick Garland’s nomination to the Supreme Court for over a year, withholding certification of a handful of Democrats would be easy, legal, and completely immoral. There’s nothing Democrats can legally do to stop Speaker Johnson from pulling this off: he can postpone swearing a member in for as long as he wants.

That keeps Speaker “MAGA Moscow Mike” Johnson in charge of the House, so they can also refuse to accept the Electoral College certificates of election from a handful of states where they claim there are “problems.”

Keep in mind, Johnson was the guy who organized the wave of 138 House members who voted not to certify Joe Biden’s election in January of 2020. That’s why Trump wanted him as speaker.

Elise Stefanik, the number 3 person in House Republican leadership, has already refused to say whether she’d vote to certify the presidential election results this November.

Others, like Kentucky Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, are repeatedly mentioning their belief that the House gets to decide who’s president, not the people or even the Electoral College. As Massie posted on X:
<blockquote>
“Maine, Colorado, and other states that might try to bureaucratically deny ballot access to any Republican nominee should remember the U.S. House of Representatives is the ultimate arbiter of whether to certify electors from those states.”
</blockquote>
In response, Elon Musk posted a one-word comment: “Interesting.”

Then, regardless of how many votes Biden won by, electoral or popular, the House simply refuses to certify the electoral college votes of enough states that the minimum of 270 isn’t reached. Under the 12th Amendment, like with the election of 1876, that throws the election to the House, where each state has one vote.

While a majority of Americans live in a state run by Democrats, a majority of the states themselves are run by Republicans. Each state gets one vote for president in the House, and right now 26 state delegations are GOP-controlled, meaning that a majority of the House would simply vote to put Trump back into the White House, 26-23 (Pennsylvania’s delegation is 50/50). All totally legal.

The Putin/Trump caucus in the House — led by Speaker Johnson — has largely given up on democracy when elections don’t give them power. As outrageous as this scenario sounds, they justify it to themselves as being essential to “save America” from “woke” Democrats.

Johnson has repeatedly said he thinks God Himself put Johnson into the speakership to fulfill some great destiny, comparing himself with Moses: stealing a presidential race “for the greater good” almost certainly qualifies as that. And, although Congress in 2022 raised the number of congressional objectors necessary to stop the certification of a presidential vote, Johnson himself was able to round up more than that number in 2020. This is eminently do-able.

Finally, the Supreme Court long ago ruled that they and the entire US court system have no jurisdiction over “political issues” that the Constitution says must be resolved by Congress. This issue of Congress’ certification of electoral college votes certainly qualifies, so, no matter what the courts might want to say or do, there’s probably no legal tool they can use to block a second Trump presidency under these circumstances.

Rightwing billionaires and neofascists within the GOP are salivating at this prospect. Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller must be giddy.

In one fell swoop they’ll “take back” the government, putting an end to that pesky problem of democracy and voters wanting nice things.

President Trump issues a new Schedule F executive order and suddenly 20,000 or so of the top management of every federal agency find themselves out of a job, being replaced by conservative ideologues who are being vetted by Heritage and other conservative think tanks as you’re reading these words.

Once they have control of both the political and the “deep state” or administrative government, these conservatives intend to set about making the changes they’ve been pushing for years:

— End gay marriage and criminalize being trans.
— Outlaw abortion and most forms of birth control.
— End the teaching of Black history.
— Outlaw DEI and affirmative action of any sort.
— Shut down most functions of the EPA so the fossil fuel and chemical industries can do whatever they want to our air and water.
— End enforcement of our anti-monopoly laws.
— Fire thousands of IRS investigators to make America safe for morbidly rich tax cheats.
— Shut down all “green” initiatives and instead “drill, baby drill.”
— Sell off public lands and parks to the highest bidders.
— Privatize Social Security and end traditional Medicare.
— End federal funding for public schools and colleges.
— Outlaw unions.

It’s truly breathtaking. They’re committed to abandoning America’s historic embrace of democracy, the “radical new form of government” that our nation’s Founders brought back into the world after it had vanished for almost 3000 years.

But, as Americans have figured out the GOP’s priorities and are disgusted by their obeisance to great wealth and Vladimir Putin, Republicans have decided that winning free and fair elections is for suckers. Stealing them is so much easier.

I don’t see any legal way such a strategy can be stopped, because it’s all based on “legal” technicalities. Like the legal technicality that George W. Bush and Donald Trump both lost the national popular vote but became president anyway (without significant protest from the American people).

When I wrote that article laying out Trump’s plan to have phony electors, et al, back in 2020, people were upset I was “giving him ideas.” Some may similarly say about this article, “Don’t tell them how to do it!”

But this has already been written about extensively by Newsweek’s editor-at-large Tom Rogers, Mark Medish & Joel McCleary for the Washington Spectator, and covered last Friday night an an opening monologue by Joy Reid. It’s public knowledge, although the media seems unwilling to discuss it.

The best way to prevent this from happening is to widely publicize their scheme so public opinion will become so intense that they fear the consequences.

It’s a thin thread holding our republic together, but at least it’s something.

Pass it along.

The liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it comes stronger than their democratic state itself. That, in its essence, is fascism — ownership of government by an individual, by a group.

Introduction: We failed to stop them
Back in the 1980s a lot of us worked like hell to try to stop the Reagan Revolution. We failed. Which is why the next few years may be our last chance to save American democracy, our environment, and what’s left of the American Dream.

When my Boomer generation was the same average age as the Millennial generation is today, back in 1990, our generation held 21.3% of the nation’s wealth.[i] Louise and I shared in that wealth; although we were still in our 30s, in 1990 we owned a profitable small business (our fourth) and a nice home in suburban Atlanta.

Our own locally owned business, a home of our own, and the knowledge that our kids would have more opportunities than we did: that was, in fact, one common way of defining the “American dream.” It was normal then.

My dad (born 1928), who worked in a tool-and-die shop, was able to buy a house, a new car every two years, and take a two-week vacation every year because the middle class in America before Reagan had a pretty damn good life. He retired in the 1990s with a full pension that let him and my mom travel the world. He was living the American Dream.

Millennials today, by contrast, are roughly the same number of people as Boomers were in 1990 but hold only 4.6% of the nation’s wealth and, if they’re the same age I was in 1990, they’re most likely struggling to own a home, are deeply in debt, and find it nearly impossible to start a small business.[ii]

Yes, you read that right. Boomers in their 30s owned 21.3 of the nation’s wealth; Millennials in their 30s today own 4.6% of the nation’s wealth.

And the story for Zoomers — those born in the late ‘90s and early oughts — is pretty much the same. As a Bank of America research report noted:

“Like the financial crisis in 2008 to 2009 for millennials, Covid will challenge and impede Gen Z's career and earning potential.”[iii]

Similarly, a Stanford University study that looked at Zoomers shows the consequence of Trump’s disastrous handling of the pandemic:

“[C]ollege graduates who start their working lives during a recession earn less for at least 10 to 15 years than those who graduate during periods of prosperity.”[iv]

What happened?  In a word, Republicans.

We Boomers remember well the Reagan Revolution of 1981, which laid the foundation for billionaires and giant corporations to impoverish the X, Millennial, and Zoomer generations.

First, GOP fat-cats came for our wages.

Those first two decades of the Reagan Revolution saw the first major attack on workers’ wages since Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt passed the National Labor Relations Act, which gave union members legal protection from physical and economic violence, way back in 1935.

In 1990, the end of the first decade when millennials were coming into the world, Republicans were still just getting started: 56% of workers who applied for union representation got their union.[v]

That wasn’t as good as during my dad’s generation — 80% of workers got a union when they petitioned for one in the 1940s — but it was still a far cry from what Millennials and Zoomers are facing today as giant trillion-dollar corporations employ the billion-dollar union-busting industry (that didn’t exist in 1980) to keep them from having democracy in the workplace.[vi]

In large part this is because “right to work for less” laws — that allow employers to gut their unions — began spreading in a big way in the 1980s and 1990s after several employer-friendly 5-4 decisions by Republicans on the Supreme Court. The notorious Taft-Hartley law that gave states the legal ability to destroy union rights was passed with Republican votes over President Harry Truman’s veto in 1947, but the anti-union National Right To Work Committee wasn’t formed until 1995.

In every single case, anti-worker right-to-work-for-less laws have been passed in states controlled by Republicans at the time of passage; Democrats fought these anti-worker laws from the beginning and continue to do so.

Nonetheless, employers have big bucks and can buy a lot of elections, judges, and politicians: what started as a trickle in the 1950s has turned into a flood since Reagan’s presidency.  Today right-to-work-for-less states include Arizona, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Missouri, Nevada, North Dakota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.[vii]

Then they came for your right to an education. 

Before Reagan became governor of California, the entire University of California system was free. Reagan did away with that as governor, and then, as president, began the methodical process of eliminating federal and state support for tuition, saying he didn’t want to “sponsor the intellectual curiosity” of “brats” who “protest my policies.”[viii]

I went to college — briefly — in the late 1960s and the only person I knew who had college debt was a friend working on his graduate degree at MSU. I paid my tuition working part-time jobs as a dishwasher at Bob’s Big Boy on Trowbridge Road in East Lansing and changing tires and pumping gas at the Esso station across the street.

My mom paid her own way through 4 years of MSU in the 1940s with the money she made as a summer lifeguard up in her hometown of Charlevoix, Michigan. My dad, like most men of his generation, was paid a monthly stipend to go to college by the GI Bill.[ix]

Now, Republicans have not only changed the bankruptcy laws so that you are no longer “cleared“ after seven years like it was when I was coming up, but you can’t even discharge student loans in bankruptcy. This was arguably one of the largest gifts the GOP ever gave the banking industry’s billionaires.

After that, they went after entrepreneurs and local businesses.

I dropped out of college in part because the small business Louise and I had started in 1969 — an electronics repair shop across the street from MSU — had grown to five employees and I was making as much money as my dad.

Back then pretty much every business in East Lansing was locally owned, from the restaurants and hotels to the furniture and clothing stores and appliance shops. The only chain store I remember was the Sears that anchored the local mall; almost all of the rest of the stores in that mall were locally owned.

But then, in 1983, President Reagan ordered the federal government to stop enforcing the anti-trust laws that had been on the books for almost 100 years; the resulting “merger mania” consumed the American economy, with “M&A Artists” (Mergers & Acquisitions) and speculative banksters, like the one Michael Douglas played in Wall Street, were ascendant.

Buying up small businesses and crushing them together into giant conglomerates, shedding “excess employees” and employing “economies of scale” were the main ways to make money, instead of serving customers and local communities. The bean counters took over.

Now their absolute market dominance and greed are driving inflation, as the normal competitive pressures that keep such behavior in check are dead. Which is why they can enthusiastically squash new, upstart businesses — from tech to retail to consumer goods — like bugs.

Thus, the chances of people today being able to successfully start a business like we did are tiny compared to what they were before the Reagan Revolution, when tens of millions of Americans owned small enterprises that they would often hand down from generation to generation.

Then they started squeezing American workers for cash when they got sick or injured.

Medical debt is another burden that came out of the Reagan Revolution that destroys millions of American families a year: for half-a-million families every year it’s so severe they have to give up their homes and possessions to declare bankruptcy.

America is the only country in the world that experiences medical bankruptcies like this.

When Louise and I started that electronics shop (as teenagers!), we were able to provide all of our employees with full medical insurance because, at that time, both insurance companies and hospitals were required by law (in Michigan and most other states) to be non-profits.

Drug companies weren’t monopolistic monoliths — it was an incredibly competitive industry — and pharmaceutical prices were reasonable, too. The country wouldn’t have tolerated asses like “Pharma Bro” back in the 1960s and 1970s and insulin, which only costs pennies to make, was dirt cheap.

But the neoliberal Reagan Revolution did away with all that, encouraging states to change their laws to bring “free market principles” to healthcare, ending nonprofit requirements for hospitals and insurance companies. There was, after all, big money to be made, and when somebody is sick and you hold the cure, you have the ultimate power to extract every last penny they have. 

As The New York Times noted in an article titled Medical Mystery: Something Happened to U.S. Health Spending After 1980:

“America was in the realm of other countries in per-capita health spending through about 1980. Then it diverged.[x]

“It’s the same story with health spending as a fraction of gross domestic product. Likewise, life expectancy. In 1980, the U.S. was right in the middle of the pack of peer nations in life expectancy at birth. But by the mid-2000s, we were at the bottom of the pack.”

Not only did the parasites get rich, but our nation’s life expectancy actually went down, relative to other wealthy nations.

Now, as the Kaiser Family Foundation reports:

“We find that 23 million people (nearly 1 in 10 adults) owe significant medical debt. The SIPP survey suggests people in the United States owe at least $195 billion in medical debt.”[xi]

And if the GOP didn’t nail millennials and Zoomers on any of the above, they figured out how to go after their need for a roof over their heads.

In the 1990s, as part of Newt Gingrich’s notorious “Contract With America,” Congress “deregulated” the financial industry to the point that it’s become a giant blood-sucking leech attached to your backs.

Thus, Millennials and Zoomers are struggling with housing costs today, and for good reason. Trillion-dollar hedge funds and investment groups are purchasing as many as half (in some towns more) of the available-for-sale housing, so they can turn them into rentals and then, when they’ve cornered the market, jack up the prices.

When my dad bought his home in the 1950s the median price of a single-family house was around 2.2 times the median American family income.[xii]  Today, the Fed says, the median house sells for $374,900 while the median American income is $35,805 — a ratio of more than ten-to-one between housing costs and annual income.[xiii] [xiv]

Louise and I bought our first home in our mid-twenties, as did many of our friends.  Banks were locally owned and worked with you; finding fixer-uppers was easy.

No more.

As the Bank of International Settlements summarized in a 2014 retrospective study of the years since the Reagan/Gingrich changes in banking and finance:

“We describe a Pareto frontier along which different levels of risk-taking map into different levels of welfare for the two parties, pitting Main Street against Wall Street. … We also show that financial innovation, asymmetric compensation schemes, concentration in the banking system, and bailout expectations enable or encourage greater risk-taking and allocate greater surplus to Wall Street at the expense of Main Street.”[xv]

It’s a fancy way of saying that big banks and hedge funds are now worth trillions while you and your community are destitute.

And forget about getting a loan to start a small business in this big-bank environment of today.

When Louise and I started our first business, we did it with a $3000 loan from a small local Michigan bank.  Back then bankers were part of the local community and eager to do what they could to help the community grow and prosper, including lending a 19-year-old money to start a business.

Nowadays they just want to extract every penny they can from you so their CEO can buy another megayacht.

And then Republicans came for our wealth, in a huge way.

Finally, perhaps the most important of the reasons Millennials and Zoomers are so badly screwed these days are the various changes in our tax code that began in the 1980s.

Reagan dropped the top income tax rate on the morbidly rich from 74% down to 27%, and cut corporate tax rates from 52% to functionally nothing.

America’s richest millennial, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, now owns fully 2 percent or 1/50th of ALL the wealth of ALL millennials in the country.[xvi]

The average billionaire pays an income tax rate of under 3%, and the majority of our nation’s largest corporations not only pay nothing in annual income taxes, but most have so gamed the system that they get money back.

And where does that money come from?  It’s taken out of the taxes the government collected from you and me.

This 42-year-long process, with Reagan’s original massive tax cuts amplified by trillions more in tax cuts for the morbidly rich from the Republican George W. Bush and Donald Trump administrations, has produced a $50 trillion transfer of real wealth from the middle class to the top 1 percent.

You read that right: they’ve taken $50 friggin trillion dollars out of our pockets over the past 42 years and stashed it in their money bins.[xvii] 

When Reagan was elected there wasn’t a single billionaire in America; now they’re appearing like popcorn, while all around us homelessness continues to spread, as Reaganomics destroys the lives of millions of Americans — particularly Millennials and Zoomers.[xviii]

That is why Americans, and particularly Millennials and Zoomers, have been had by the GOP.

And now that Republicans have handed all that money over to the top 1% — and five corrupt Republicans on the Supreme Court ruled in their 2010 Citizens United decision that billionaires and corporations owning politicians isn’t corruption or bribery but “free speech” — it’s getting harder and harder to do anything about it.

Every time any sort of reform — even modest, reasonable reforms — come before Congress, a united block of Republicans in the Senate haul in another billion dollars in campaign contributions and Senator Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and his friends kill it with the filibuster.

And don’t get me started on climate change, which Republicans, right across-the-board, continue to deny, in deference to the fossil fuel industry and its billionaires who fund their elections. The GOP has put money and power above the fate and future of our and our children’s planet.

They even tried to end our 240-year experiment in democratic self-governance, and are now actively embracing neofascist autocracy, openly trying to emulate the rightwing strongman governments that have taken over Russia and Hungary.

Like the far-right did in Russia and Hungary, Republicans have succeeded in overturning the right to abortion in the states they control and are openly embracing homophobia and misogyny.

And did I mention over 400 million guns drenching our country in blood, and Republican Senator John Cornyn recently saying that Republicans are unified across-the-board to prevent any further action to stop gun violence in America?

And now, Republicans are trying to indoctrinate our children in their white supremacy and racism by forcing teachers to push a false narrative about American history — all while they try to rig our elections by purging millions of minority, Millennial, and Zoomer voters from the rolls with the 2018 blessing of five Republicans on a corrupted Supreme Court.

The good news, however, is that, increasingly, older and younger generations are working together to throw Republicans out of office and elect progressive Democrats who understand these issues and know how to do something about it. 

From 80-year-old Senator Bernie Sanders to 25-year-old progressive Democrat Maxwell Frost of Florida who won a House seat in 2022, progressives are growing in political power at the same time America is waking up from the fog of BS Republicans have been crop-dusting over us since 1981.

All is not lost; change is in the air. And Millennials and Zoomers are leading the way.

Saturday Report 8/2/25 — Has Trump Heralded a New “Gilded Age?” What Comes Next?

The Best of the Rest of the News

Just a reminder that some idiot posted our zoom link in a public venue, so it has been changed. If you’re a paid subscriber you got the new link in email this morning from Nigel. Our apologies for the inconvenience.

— Has Trump heralded a new “gilded age?” What comes next? Like Gatsby’s 1925 West Egg mansion — stuffed with opulence but rotting underneath — Trump’s America is plunging headlong into a new Gilded Age, this time gilded not with gold but with grift. The signs are everywhere. There’s the multimillion-dollar White House ballroom Trump wants built for his private fundraising galas, while federal workers go without raises. There’s the Qatari luxury jet/bribe gifted to him — worth hundreds of millions — that Senate Republicans just voted to let him keep after leaving office, even after the Pentagon diverted nearly a billion dollars from a nuclear weapons maintenance program to refurbish it. And while billionaires hoard wealth and party with their wannabe king, a chilling jobs report has reminded the rest of us just how fragile the working class has become in this deregulated, union-busting, trickle-down circus. (Trump just fired the woman in charge of the agency that compiled the statistics because he doesn’t like the numbers; nobody in the world will trust future employment numbers out of this administration.) Like in Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, this isn’t sustainable. The first Gilded Age — also birthed by Republican policies — collapsed into the Republican Great Depression. If history is any guide, this one will, too. Trump has built a country of spectacle and showmanship, where glitter masks decay and inequality reigns supreme. But even the most gold-plated illusions eventually crack. The question is: will we stop it before the crash, or let this corrupt spectacle drag us into a second Republican Great Depression like The Fourth Turning predicts?

— GOP lawmaker runs into a buzzsaw at town hall. Republicans showing up in public to defend their and Trump’s obscene behavior is becoming like trying to defy gravity; it rarely works out well. Mike Johnson knows this, which is why he won’t do town halls and he’s advised all the other Republicans to likewise avoid contact with the dirty public (but keep up the big-bucks dinners with lobbyists and donors). Wisconsin Republican Congressman Brian Stiel thought he could pull it off, and was quickly set straight. While about 50 presumably Democratic protesters showed up outside the venue, inside the presumably Republican constituents of Stiel’s were having none of his BS. He tried to defend ICE wearing masks and was booed down. Same thing happened when he said it was important for Republicans to have cut Medicaid with the Big Ugly Bill. One voter called him an “embarrassment,” another said, “You’re not the right fit for us anymore,” and a third said: “I am so disappointed in how you represent us as the citizen of Walworth County. Southeast Wisconsin has not been represented by you. President Trump seems to run southeast Wisconsin through you.” While Stiel thought he could defy political gravity, it didn’t work; this is another example showing there’s a good chance for Republicans to get wiped out in the ’26 elections, which, of course, is why they’re so vigorously trying to gerrymander Red states and purge millions of voters from the rolls in Blue cities. Will it work? Will Gavin Newsom call a special election to redraw California’s maps? Will other Democratic states follow Illinois Governor JB Pritzker’s advice to “fight gerrymandering fire with fire” and Congressman and Progressive Caucus President Emeritus Mark Pocan’s advice for Blue states to begin their own voter purges? Stay tuned…

— First it was Nazi salutes; now Elon wants you to know that “women are built to be traded.” Seriously. Check this out; it sorta speaks for itself and tells you everything you never wanted to know about this bizarre billionaire African immigrant who is now the GOP’s single largest donor:

Elon Musk reposted this misogynistic and dehumanizing take on X earlier this week.
— Trump wants the federal government to be able to track every one of your medical and health issues in real time, and Big Tech is all excited about being able to get their hands on your private data. Georgetown University law professor who specializes in public health, Lawrence Gostin, noted, “There are enormous ethical and legal concerns. Patients across America should be very worried that their medical records are going to be used in ways that harm them and their families.” The Associated Press reports: “More than 60 companies, including major tech companies like Google, Amazon and Apple as well as health care giants like UnitedHealth Group and CVS Health, have agreed to share patient data in the system.” Just what we all needed, right? These guys snooping into our private medical information and then sharing it all with Trump, Noem, Bondi, and ICE…

— Trump is threatening other countries with steep tariffs if they don’t change their sovereign foreign policy decisions. The Constitution says only Congress can impose tariffs; it’s unambiguous. The Emergency Powers Act that Trump is citing as justification for his imposing unilateral tariffs doesn’t even mention the word “tariffs.” What he’s doing is entirely illegal and no business is going to build a factory here just because Trump threw up a tariff when they know he could (and probably will) change his mind next month or the next president — or a future Congress or the Supreme Court — can cancel his tariffs. That’s why Trump’s tariffs are not only screwing up America’s standing in the world but also taking a hammer to our economy. But now he’s using them as punishments; in this case, going after Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney for saying that he’d support a Palestinian state. Felon Trump and accused felon Netanyahu want nothing to do with that, so Trump’s saying he’s going to hit Canada — or, more correctly, he’s going to hit American consumers of Canadian goods — with a 35% tariff. This is nuts and, as I mentioned yesterday, he’s only doing it because it forces leaders of countries around the world to come grovel before him the way he’d always hoped the guys on Wall Street and in New York high society would do (but they refused). Trump’s fragile ego has become a wrecking ball that threatens a second Republican Great Depression. Buckle up…

— Where are the 4,725 Epstein wire transfers that Trump, Noem, and Bondi are hiding? That’s the question my senator, Ron Wyden, wants answers to. He’s unearthed proof that the details of the cash movements totaling over a billion dollars are in the possession of the Trump administration, but they’re not only refusing to release them, they won’t even acknowledge Wyden’s demand for transparency. It could, after all, blow open the entire underage sex-trafficking business Epstein was running out of his two homes, each just down the street from his “best friend” Trump’s homes in New York City and Palm Beach. We also learned yesterday that the DOJ has been going through the Epstein documents and redacting anything that has to do with Trump. Meanwhile, in what’s almost certainly the down payment in the deal Trump’s criminal defense lawyer Todd Blanche worked out with her, Ghislaine Maxwell was moved yesterday from a real women’s prison in Florida to a “minimum security facility” in Texas that’s more like a women’s sorority house. This is particularly odd since it’s against the law as Allison Gill notes: you can’t put sex offenders into minimum security facilities (because they could represent a threat to the other inmates; the same reason there are no violent offenders there). Somebody waived that rule — or Blanche/Noem/Bondi/Trump are ignoring it — and the media’s not even asking who or why. The big question now is whether Trump’s base will accept it (Fox already has) when the coverup is complete, Maxwell testifies that he had nothing to do with underage girls but Bill Clinton was sure there, and Trump declares “total transparency.” I’m betting, reluctantly, that they will and it’ll all blow over by November, but with this case it’s impossible to know for sure.

— Geeky Science! There was a mass die off of Monarch butterflies is 2024 and we now know why. Over 90 percent of Monarch butterflies that were common across North America just 50 years ago are gone, and there was another mass die-off at a California over-wintering site last December. Up until now, nobody has known for sure what’s killing the insects; the main suspects have been pesticides, climate change, and loss of habitat to development. So a plucky group of scientists visited the mass death site and autopsied a bunch of the Monarchs; most had as many as 7 different pesticides in their bodies, all at lethal levels. We have to stop using these deadly chemicals (that aren’t good for us, either!) and return to sustainable agriculture practices. Roundup, for example, is known to cause cancer in humans and dogs, but the last Trump administration said they could ditch the warning labels. You can kill weeds with high-strength vinegar, and Neem oil is a great insecticide; there are lots of natural alternatives to the chemicals that are applied both commercially and in residential environments and we should all use them, encourage our HOAs and neighbors to use them, and push our politicians to get the EPA back on the job.

The Coming Republican Depression: How the GOP Turned America Into a Powder Keg, and Is About to Light the Match
Housing bubbles, financial scams, and political sabotage are converging into a historic, preventable disaster.

Republicans may be fixing to crash the economy again — Republican presidents oversaw 10 of the last 11 recessions and the Republican Great Depression — and they’re doing it to satisfy the greed of the billionaires they serve.

Today, for example, is the day that some of Trump‘s worst tariffs are supposed to go into effect, and many folks on Wall Street are deciding where they want to hide when the ceiling starts falling in. The horrible jobs report just released hours ago highlights not only how bad things were in July, but they had to “revise downward by 285,000 jobs” previous reports; it looks like Trump’s people have been cooking the books.

The Financial Times is on it; they published an article this week titled, “The US economy is more fragile than it appears.” It’s author, Tej Parikh, points out that our housing market is in trouble and starting to look like it did around the time of the Bush Housing Crash in 2008, that spending patterns are changing in alarming ways (my phrase, not his), and that both the labor and stock markets are vulnerable. The article is frankly alarming.

And former labor secretary Robert Reich titled his brilliant newsletter yesterday: “Be Warned: The Financial Bubble Will Soon Burst.” The former Clinton cabinet member writes:

“The financial economy — stocks, bonds, and their derivatives — is in for a big reality check, and I think it will happen soon.”

America has stared into this abyss before; three times, in fact. In the 1770s, a brutal financial crisis driven by colonial overextension, monopolistic control by the British East India Company, and political corruption helped spark the American Revolution. In the 1850s, it was wildcat banking, land speculation, and a collapse in trust that helped produce the Panic of 1857 and push the nation toward civil war. And in 1929, Republican deregulation, tax cuts for the rich, financial speculation, and an all-out assault on labor exploded into the Republican Great Depression.

Today, every one of the fuse lines that set off those explosions is once again being laid by a Republican president and Party that has abandoned any pretense of economic stewardship or patriotism.

They are actively destabilizing the pillars of our economy, undermining our democracy, and gutting the social contract that held us together for nearly a century. And unless we act — forcefully, quickly, and collectively — we may soon experience a collapse that makes 2008 look like a speed bump.

The risk of a modern economic depression is not academic or merely theoretical. It’s also not fearmongering. It is real, it is avoidable, and it is being amplified by a political movement that openly disdains regulation, despises democracy, and seeks to roll back every gain the American middle class has made since FDR dragged this country out of the last Republican-created catastrophe.

We are now living under a Republican president whose party has:

— Repeatedly held the full faith and credit of the United States hostage in debt ceiling standoffs designed to force cruel cuts to programs that serve ordinary people;

— Demanded the Fed lower interest rates in a way that could push the nation into an inflationary spiral even as wages stagnate and housing becomes unaffordable for the bottom 90%;

— Pushed for the end of regulations on banks, fossil fuel companies, tech monopolies, and Wall Street speculators, even as their recklessness increases systemic risk;

— Championed massive tax cuts for billionaires and multinational corporations, ballooning the deficit while cutting benefits and raising taxes on working people;

— Enabled trade wars and supply chain disruptions while cutting support for green manufacturing and public investment;

— Promoted and made billions from crypto;

— And perhaps most grotesquely, embraced open authoritarianism and white nationalism, eroding the rule of law and the very stability on which economic confidence depends.

Every one of these moves destabilizes the foundation of modern prosperity. And every one of them echoes the warning signs of past collapses. The mechanisms of economic catastrophe are not mysterious. We’ve seen them before.

Start with sovereign debt and fiscal dysfunction.

In 2023 and 2024, House Republicans repeatedly brought us to the brink of default just to slash food aid, gut Medicaid, and kill green jobs. Now, in 2025, they’re salivating over a new “Balanced Budget Amendment” that would make countercyclical investment during recessions illegal. That’s economic suicide.

When demand collapses, the government must spend to stabilize the system. That’s Econ 101. But the GOP wants a permanent austerity straitjacket. Why? Because billionaires don’t suffer in recessions: they buy everything at a discount and radically increase their own wealth when things rebound. For the morbidly rich, Republican recessions and depressions are “buying opportunities”: it’s class war, plain and simple.

Then there’s financial speculation and asset bubbles.

We’re once again living in an era of rampant unregulated financial engineering:
— Crypto Ponzi schemes.
— AI stock frenzies.
— Private equity gutting essential companies and loading them with debt.
— Trillions of dollars sloshing around the system chasing yield, while regulators like the SEC and FTC are neutered by courts stacked with right-wing ideologues.

Remember what happened in 1929? The same “let the market police itself” ideology brought the whole thing crashing down. The difference now is that the contagion would be global and could even be instantaneous.

Trade shocks and de-dollarization are looming risks, too.

Trump’s tariffs hurt American farmers and manufacturers. His talk of a new 10% universal tariff could ignite a global trade war and could push countries like China, Brazil, or Saudi Arabia to finally abandon the dollar as the reserve currency.

If that happens — if Treasury bonds stop being the world’s safe haven — we’re looking at a collapse in our ability to finance debt, a surge in interest rates, a crash in the housing market, and mass layoffs. And the Republicans? They cheer it on. They think chaos is good politics.

And then there are tariffs: there’s a reason the Founders of this country and Framers of the Constitution gave the power to enact tariffs exclusively to Congress. They knew that nobody would build a factory here unless they knew that a tariff defending their manufacturing would be in place for the decades it would take to recover their investment costs.

When tariffs are simply slapped here and there willy-nilly by a single man and can be easily repealed by the next president, no competent business manager would take them seriously: the only thing tariffs do, under these circumstances, is damage the economy. Meanwhile, Trump’s tariffs so far are going to cost the average American family $2,400 this year.

And, from Donald Trump’s point of view, they force foreign leaders to come grovel in front of him, which absolutely delights him. He brags about it, once noting that, “They are kissing my ass.” This is not trade policy; he’s just doing this for his ego.

And what about public confidence and how the loss of it could cause a depression?

You can’t have a functioning economy without trust in government, in institutions, in money itself. But the GOP has made destroying trust its central project.

They lie about elections. They undermine the courts. They spread conspiracy theories. They smear career civil servants. They openly praise authoritarianism.

When half the population no longer believes in the legitimacy of its own government, and when the other half sees that government captured by billionaires and zealots, economic confidence evaporates.

People stop spending. They stop investing. They retreat into cash and hoarding. That’s how depressions spiral out of control.

Now layer on climate instability and its ability to wreck an economy and you have a real mess.

The GOP’s climate denialism is not just immoral, it’s economically suicidal. Hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and heat waves are destroying billions in assets every year.

Insurance markets are collapsing in California, Florida, and Louisiana. Agricultural yields are falling. Water shortages are hitting the Southwest. Floods are wiping out the Midwest and the South while wildfires torch the West. But Republicans keep slashing climate research, killing green energy subsidies, and banning ESG investment strategies. They are literally outlawing the future.

It’s a five-alarm fire, and the Republican arsonists are demanding more gasoline.

There is, however, a way out. We’ve done it before.

After the last Republican-created depression, Franklin Roosevelt rejected the dogma of austerity and implemented the most ambitious suite of Keynesian policies in world history. He put people to work. He regulated the banks. He taxed the rich. He unionized the workforce. He broke up monopolies. He guaranteed Social Security, unemployment insurance, and the right to organize.

That system — Keynesian demand-side economics — created the greatest middle class the world has ever seen. It lifted millions out of poverty, stabilized capitalism, and gave rise to the postwar economic boom. It literally created the modern American middle class.

But starting in 1981, Reagan and the GOP declared war on that system. They gutted antitrust enforcement. They slashed top tax rates. They crushed unions. They deregulated finance. They privatized public goods. They shifted the burden of funding government from the rich to the working class. And then they blamed the victims of their policies for the resulting inequality and instability.

Now they’re going for the kill shot.

Trump and his Republican Party are not just misguided; they are dangerous. Their policies are not just bad; they are existential threats to economic stability. They’ve created the conditions for collapse, and they’ll blame immigrants, Democrats, or queer kids when it happens.

We can’t let them. We have to take our country back, economically, politically, morally.

That means rejecting trickle-down nonsense and restoring Keynesian demand-side policies. It means breaking up monopolies and rebuilding a regulatory state that works. It means bringing back progressive taxation and closing loopholes for billionaires. It means massive investment in clean energy, public health, education, and infrastructure. It means rebuilding trust in democracy by reversing Citizens United, defending voting rights, rooting out corruption, and calling out fascism where we see it.

This must be at the core of the platform Democrats run on this fall and during next year’s midterms.

The risk of a depression is real. But the solution is in our hands. We just have to stop letting the Republican Party light the matches.

Bribes, Bias, and South Park: Trump’s Authoritarian Agenda Hits Primetime
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Trump is the first president in American history to seize the nation's newsrooms and attack a cartoon in the same week…
Thom Hartmann

The media’s job in a democratic society is to speak truth to power, not to suck up to it. But last week, CBS and its parent company Paramount waved the white flag, handing Donald Trump a $16 million bribe and agreeing to censor their own newsroom to curry favor with a twice-impeached, multiply-indicted rapist authoritarian who lost the popular vote twice.

That is not journalism. That’s capitulation. And it’s devastating to democracies.

The CBS merger with Skydance should never have been a political issue. In normal times, regulatory agencies like the FCC operate independently, applying laws without fear or favor. But these are not normal times.

Trump’s FCC — under the control of far-right ideologue Brendan Carr, who helped draft the fascism-friendly blueprint known as Project 2025 — made it clear they’d block the deal unless CBS “cleaned house.” Carr even bragged on CNBC that the merger only went through because Skydance promised to remove “bias” from CBS News. By “bias,” of course, he means “truth.”

Trump and Carr appear to be demanding that CBS stop telling the truth about the GOP’s fascist drift, stop investigating corruption, and stop airing facts that make Trump and the MAGA movement look bad. And CBS didn’t just roll over: they cut a personal check to Trump for $16 million, reportedly threw in an equal amount in free advertising, canceled Stephen Colbert’s show to eliminate critical comedy, and agreed to install a literal “monitor” in their newsroom to hunt down and eliminate so-called “leftwing bias.”

This is not just grotesque. It’s dangerous.

Installing government-friendly “monitors” in newsrooms to silence dissent is one of the first things authoritarians do when they take power. It happened in Hungary under Viktor Orbán. It happened in Russia under Putin. In Germany in the early 1930s, Hitler handed control of the media to Joseph Goebbels and banned reporting that contradicted Nazi talking points.

What Trump and Carr are doing is textbook fascism: co-opting the press, criminalizing dissent, and demanding personal loyalty above all else across both government and the media.

The problem, of course, is that reality has a well-known leftwing bias. That’s because reality, unlike rightwing ideology, is rooted in facts. For example:

Trickle-down economics has never helped the working class; it’s a scam to transfer wealth to the rich.

Immigrants are not more likely to commit crimes; they’re less likely.

Late-term abortions are rare and almost always involve severe fetal abnormalities or risks to the mother; women don’t “love getting abortions” or do so with little thought.

Unions raise wages and reduce inequality; they don’t “steal from workers.”

Climate change is real and accelerating, and fossil fuel companies and Republicans have known it — and spent billions to cover it up — for decades.

Renewable energy is cheaper than coal, gas, or oil in most of the world.

People on public assistance are usually not “lazy” but are either disabled, working or actively seeking work, or living in areas where there is no work.

Raising the minimum wage doesn’t increase unemployment; it boosts the economy which increases employment.

Universal healthcare works in every other developed nation; it’s not “impossible” to implement here in America.

The U.S. was not founded as a Christian nation, but as a secular republic.

Yet when these facts and others become “too political” for CBS to air — when truth is treated as liberal bias — we’re in real trouble. If CBS can’t push back on obvious lies because it’s afraid of offending Trump’s FCC, how long before every newsroom falls in line?

This is exactly how freedom of the press — and then freedom for everybody — dies: not with a bang, but with a checkbook and a veiled threat. When media companies start self-censoring to avoid regulatory retribution, they become lapdogs, not watchdogs.

And Trump isn’t even trying to hide this. He’s bragging about it.

Last week, the White House even released a full-on tantrum of a statement attacking South Park for mocking Trump. The show dared to suggest that combining the powers of the presidency with lawsuits and bribes might be a bad thing for democracy. In response, Trump’s staff accused the show of being “irrelevant” and “desperate for attention.”

Can you name any other president in American history who issued a press release attacking a cartoon?

But Trump’s not just punching down with his words: he’s using the full weight of the federal government to go after anyone who defies him. He’s already targeted universities, law firms, prosecutors, and journalists with bogus DOJ investigations and regulatory harassment. Now he’s turned the FCC into his personal censorship bureau.

The bribes paid by CBS and ABC weren’t one-offs, they were the first installment in a classic protection racket.

That’s not America. That’s a mob state being run by a man who behaves like a mob boss.

So what do we do? First, we must stop pretending this is normal. It’s not. CBS didn’t make a “business decision,”they submitted to a political shakedown. And the rest of the media should not let them get away with it.

Second, we must speak out, loudly and relentlessly. Let CBS know that rolling over for a wannabe strongman is unacceptable. Tell your local stations you want truth, not Trump-approved propaganda. Support independent journalism and media outlets willing to tell the truth even when it’s unpopular. Subscribe. Donate. Amplify their work.

And finally, we need to get serious about defending our democracy. That means voting like our freedoms depend on it, because they do. It means rejecting candidates who would silence the press and stack the courts and install “monitors” in our newsrooms. It means recognizing authoritarianism when it’s right in front of us and calling it what it is. It means getting inside your local Democratic Party and fighting for real progressive change and the survival of our republic.

Trump has shown us, again and again, that he will use every lever of power to silence his critics and punish his enemies. Now he has the FCC and a major news network doing his bidding. If we stay silent now, we may not get another chance.

Democracy dies when people stop caring. Let’s prove that we still do.

The Cruelty Machine: Inside Trump’s America, Where Pain is Policy & Fear is the Fuel
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Trump has built a movement that glorifies cruelty and cloaks greed in the language of patriotism and faith…
Thom Hartmann
Jul 31, 2025

Early this month, ICE agents detained a 6‑year‑old Honduran boy battling leukemia as he left an immigration court in Los Angeles with his mother and sister.

A child fighting for his life was ripped from his fragile medical routine and locked away for over a month, interrupting his treatment, crying himself to sleep night after night in a concrete cell instead of a hospital bed.

This wasn’t a mistake. It was cruelty by design: an intentional act of terror by a government that now treats compassion as weakness and suffering as a political weapon.

— ProPublica this morning published a report titled “Bloodied faces, sobbing children: Immigration officers smash car windows to speed up arrests,” documenting massive use of physical violence, including over 50 occasions where car windows were smashed and examples of people who were beaten up by masked, anonymous ICE thugs. The reporters call this level of police brutality “unprecedented,” pointing out that no police agency had ever behaved like this prior to the Trump administration.

— The Guardian reports in an article titled “Georgia detainee with prosthetic legs who objected to flooded cell sent to solitary”:
<blockquote>
“A Liberian-born man detained by ICE in Georgia was put in solitary confinement after complaining about flooding in his cell that he said was potentially dangerous for his electronic prosthetic legs… Since then, his challenges in detention have included the screws coming out of his prosthetic legs, causing him to fall and injure his hand, and being unable to obtain new, fitted legs…

“Taylor was brought to the US from Liberia by his mother on a medical visa when he was a small child. He went through 16 operations. He has two fingers on his right hand. Now 46, he has lived in the US nearly his entire life, works as a barber, is active in promoting cancer awareness in his community and got engaged only 10 days before Ice detained him in January. Despite having a pending application for US residence – commonly known as a ‘green card’ – Ice detained and locked up Taylor in January…”
</blockquote>
When Donald Trump descended that golden escalator ten years ago and called Mexicans rapists and murderers, we should have known what was coming. What many mistook for bombast or political performance art in 2015 has since revealed itself to be something much darker: cruelty as a political strategy, an ideology, and a governing philosophy.

Here on the last day of July 2025, after six months of Trump’s second term and with a fully compliant GOP marching behind him, it’s undeniable: this is not incompetence or accidental malice. It is deliberate. Strategic. Authoritarianism.

Cruelty is not a bug in Trumpism; it is the central operating system. And it has become the organizing principle of today’s Republican Party as you can see from the glee with which Republican members of Congress strip rights and supports from vulnerable people, and rightwing media stars brag about ICE’s brutal tactics.

This administration’s cruelty isn’t just directed at migrants or protestors or the poor: it’s aimed at democracy itself.

When they normalize suffering, when they use state power to punish the vulnerable and reward the cruel, they erode everything that holds a pluralistic democracy together: the rule of law, institutional checks and balances, civic trust, and the belief at the foundation of every functional and successful society that, “We’re all in this together.”

For example, look at the “Big Beautiful Bill” that Trump, Majority Leader John Thune, and House Speaker Mike Johnson rammed through Congress last month with much fanfare and zero Democratic support.

They called it “patriotic” and “pro-growth.” In reality, it’s one of the most draconian pieces of legislation ever passed in modern American history. It strips healthcare from over 23 million Americans by gutting the ACA’s Medicaid expansion, throws up roadblocks to staying on Medicaid, and cuts subsidies to working families.

It raises taxes on middle- and lower-income households by removing credits and deductions that working people rely on, even as it slashes corporate, income, and estate taxes for the morbidly rich. It slashes funding for Medicaid, food stamps, school lunches, Pell Grants, Head Start, and housing assistance. It cuts Medicare and accelerates the GOP’s long-sought privatization of Medicare and Social Security.

And then it turns around and hands over $4 trillion in tax cuts to the very billionaires who fund Trump’s brutal machine.

Trump and the billionaire boys’ club who got him elected and are in his cabinet — including the same crew that reprogrammed their social media algorithms to favor the far right and suppress independent and progressive media — are now openly celebrating policies that will kill poor people. That isn’t hyperbole; it’s the core of their political project made possible by the corrupt Citizens United Supreme Court decision.

It’s a project built on fear, exclusion, and the weaponization of difference. What began with chants of “Build the Wall” has metastasized into a state-run deportation machine that operates like a fascist police force. ICE, now expanded and unaccountable, no longer just terrorizes undocumented immigrants; it raids sanctuary cities, surveils citizens who participate in protests, and detains people without charges in the name of “national security.”

Under Trump’s second term, ICE has become America’s gestapo — the word literally means “secret police” — just as it was in Germany. And like their 20th-century predecessors, they operate by inspiring fear: in our case with black vans, anonymous uniforms, hidden faces and badges, unrestrained violence, and warrantless searches. They are Trump’s domestic terror squad, designed not to protect but to intimidate, and answerable only to him.

This isn’t just authoritarianism: it’s moral rot.

Trump’s cruelty is designed not only to consolidate power but to distort our collective sense of right and wrong. For today’s Republicans, empathy is now considered weakness. Kindness is called “wokeness.” Helping your neighbor is labeled “socialism.”

Faith has been turned into a weapon for the powerful rather than a refuge for the weary. Jesus wept — and not metaphorically — when he saw the temple turned into a marketplace. What would He say now about supposedly Christian pastors praising a man who brags about sexual assault, pardons rapists and cop-killers, and surrounds himself with grifters and predators?

And let’s not forget Jeffrey Epstein and the ongoing coverup of the elites in his orbit. The man died in federal custody under suspicious circumstances. The list of powerful men who flew on his plane, visited his island, and knew of his crimes continues to grow, yet the institutional GOP, which claims to be the party of morality, is silent. Worse than silent, they deflect, deny, or defend; they even shut down Congress to avoid having to vote on releasing the Epstein papers and videos.

This is exactly what Jesus warned against in the Sermon on the Mount: the hypocrites who pray loudly in public but are ravening wolves in secret. What morality is this?

The GOP today wraps itself in the language of faith and family, but what they practice is cruelty, racism, misogyny, and hierarchy. They criminalize compassion, turning public school teachers, judges, social workers, and librarians into targets for harassment. They encourage neighbors to report each other. They celebrate vigilantism. They ban books, persecute trans kids, and militarize the police, all while calling it “freedom.”

And it’s not just Trump. The entire Republican Party has reinvented itself in his image. From J.D. Vance, who once warned about Trump’s destructiveness and now echoes his every word, to state governors outlawing drag shows while doing nothing about gun violence in their own schools, the cruelty, violence, and even the deaths of our schoolchildren are the feature.

This political movement and the economic inequality it’s caused through 44 years of Reaganism, gutting our middle class while making a handful of billionaires richer than any pharaoh or king in history, is corroding our social fabric.

Families are being torn apart by deportation, addiction, and poverty. Communities are afraid to speak up or organize. Schools are underfunded, teachers frightened, parents angry and divided. Faith institutions are splintered, some radicalized into political cults, others silenced by fear of retribution.

And through it all, the GOP blames the victims — poor people, immigrants, Black activists, women seeking reproductive healthcare — for the problems Republicans themselves have created.

Trump’s America today is in decline, but it’s not because we’ve become too compassionate. It’s because we’ve allowed the morbidly rich to hoard wealth, the powerful to dodge responsibility, and the cruel to dominate the public square.

And yet history tells us there’s another way. Compassion is not weakness; it’s the glue of civilization and has been throughout human history.

FDR built the New Deal on compassion. LBJ built the Great Society on the moral imperative to lift up the least among us. Democrats fought — against fierce Republican opposition — for every major social advance of the last century: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, the minimum wage, voting rights, civil rights, safe food, women’s rights, union rights, gay marriage, student loans, public education, free college.

And the American people — time and again — chose compassion. Until the GOP figured out how to gerrymander, suppress, and lie their way into power. Reagan called poor people “welfare queens.” Gingrich told Americans to hate our own government. Trump put the knife in the back of democracy itself.

But it doesn’t have to end this way.

We need a return to morality: not the fake, punitive “morality” of the Christian right, but the genuine morality of justice, equality, and care that Jesus talked about. Of feeding the hungry and welcoming the stranger. Of binding up the brokenhearted and lifting the fallen.

That is not “radical leftism”: it’s the moral center of every faith, every humanist tradition, and the glue that holds together every decent society.

Government is the only force large enough to address systemic injustice, and it should be used to heal, not harm. We must reclaim our government as the instrument of public good. We must reject the outrage politics of the GOP — the hate, the lies, the violence and bigotry — and recommit ourselves to the American promise of liberty and justice for all.

Only 26% of eligible voters made Donald Trump president in 2024. That means three out of four Americans either didn’t vote or voted against him. We are the majority. But we must act like it.

Double-check your voter registration — every month — especially if you live in a Red state, where Republican-led purges are removing people from the rolls by the hundreds of thousands as you’re reading these words.

They are afraid of your voice. They are afraid of your compassion. They are afraid that if you show up, their cruelty will lose.

We are better than this complete repudiation of the ideals, aspirations, and founding visions of America. And now, more than ever, we must prove it. Not with hashtags or thoughts and prayers but with votes, with organizing, with moral clarity, and with the unshakable belief that in America, cruelty should never again become policy.

Let’s bring compassion and morality back to the center of American life, and demand that our elected representatives and those running for office do the same. Before it’s too late.

Pass it along.

The Authoritarian Cliff
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
We’re standing on the edge of the authoritarian cliff, With flags in our hands and truth adrift

(Verse 1)
The sky was calm, the streets were still
But he cried out for war from the Capitol Hill
No riot, no fire, no threat in the air
Just a man with a crown and a vacant stare

He sent the soldiers into our towns
Said he’d save us all as he tore things down
The sirens screamed what the headlines missed
Another freedom erased with a clenched white fist

Share

(Chorus)
We’re standing on the edge of the authoritarian cliff
With flags in our hands and truth adrift
Hungary fell, and Russia too
And now the mirror shows a red, white, blue
So raise your voice before it slips
Before we tumble from the authoritarian cliff

(Verse 2)
They called it order, they called it law
But it was theater wrapped in martial awe
A test of silence, a trial by fear
While the Constitution disappeared

He jailed the truth, fired the wise
Fed the courtrooms calculated lies
Called every loss a stolen prize
Now justice wears a thin disguise

(Chorus)
We’re standing on the edge of the authoritarian cliff
With shadows behind us, and no safety net if
We keep on watching, keep playing dumb
Then we deserve what we’ve become
Speak now, or the silence rips—
And down we go from the authoritarian cliff

(Bridge)
There’s a playbook written in cold regret
Of tyrants risen, and nations that forget
And we are reading Act III aloud
While the crowd still cheers, and the press still bows

But I won’t sing the strongman’s song
Won’t let him drag this soul along
To camps, to walls, to courts gone blind
To a future we’ll wish we’d left behind

(Chorus)
We’re standing on the edge of the authoritarian cliff
With history’s ghosts whispering “resist”
This ain’t a drill, it’s not pretend
This is how the republic ends
Unless we fight, unless we lift—
Each other from the authoritarian cliff

(Outro)
So light the truth, and pass it fast
Because the time for warnings has almost passed
One more step, and that’s the fall—
We either rise, or lose it all.
