Right To Work For Less
In 1935, Congress passed, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed, the National Labor 
Relations Act, often referred to as the Wagner Act, legalizing labor unions in the 
United States for the first time. It was referred to as “the most radical piece of 
legislation ever passed by the United States Congress.”[lvii] New York’s Democratic 
Senator Robert Wagner was the new law’s main author, and his legislative aide, Simon H. 
Rifkind, told Theodore J. St. Antoine in 1986 that there were several reasons for the 
law.[lviii]

First, there was considerable labor unrest across the nation; it had been particularly 
bloody over the preceding fifty or so years since the labor movement first emerged in a 
big way in the 1880s. Employers would hire private security companies or pay off local 
politicians and police to harass, beat, and often even kill workers to prevent 
unionization.

One of the most infamous examples was the Ludlow Massacre in 1914. After John D. 
Rockefeller expelled striking workers from his company town, they set up a tent city. 
Colorado National Guard troops were brought in and set up a machine gun on a bluff 
overlooking the site, then used it to strafe the tents. Women and children escaped to 
small crawlspace “basements” they’d dug under the tents, so the Guard soaked the tents 
with Rockefeller’s kerosene and lit them on fire, killing dozens of women and children.[lix]

St. Antoine wrote that the goals, “of the Wagner Act were (1) to advance social justice 
and (2) to channel protest and defuse potential rebellion,” adding that, “it was 
essentially a ‘conservative’ measure.”[lx] He added that Senator Wagner thought it was 
high time America joined the rest of the developed world in offering union protections 
to workers, as unions were by that time widespread across the world, particularly in 
Europe.

The social justice part of the equation had to do with lifting working people out of 
poverty and into the American Dream of what would become known over following decades 
as the middle class. The legislation established the right of workers to unionize a 
business and then require all of the company’s hourly workers to join or pay dues to 
the union.

This “must join” provision is referred to as a “closed shop” (as opposed to an “open 
shop” where people are free to join or pay dues to unions or not). A third type of 
organization was called an “agency shop,” which is where employees can opt out of union 
membership but still must pay union dues, since the union incurs the costs of 
negotiating and enforcing contracts on behalf of all workers, whether they’re union 
members or not.

In 1937, the US Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Wagner Act, cementing 
it into the American business and labor landscape.

This led to an explosion of union activity across the nation and the rapid emergence of 
an empowered working class. It also infuriated business owners and the Republican 
politicians they owned.

Following World War II, the GOP had a major electoral victory in the election of 1946. 
Democrats had been solely in charge of the federal government from FDR’s 1932 election 
right up until that time, but in that election the GOP swept both the House and the 
Senate and held them for the following two years. Thus, in 1947, Republicans pushed 
through the notorious Taft-Hartley Act that allowed individual states to opt out of 
the closed shop provisions of the Wagner Act.

President Harry Truman vetoed the bill, but Republicans mustered the votes to override 
his veto and the act stood and stands to this day. Since its passage, 28 Republican-
controlled states have chosen to opt out of Wagner Act provisions, driving the de-
unionization of America.

They’ve done this while saying they’re simply allowing people in their states a “right 
to work.” That phrase was coined in its current meaning by Texas Republican operative 
and head of the Christian American Association, Vance Muse (1890-1950), who’d been an 
ardent opponent of unions, arguing that they would one day allow Black and Jewish people 
entry into industrial workplaces. It was quickly adopted by the GOP and is used to 
describe union-busting activity to this day.

Not everybody was fooled, though. As Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said in a 1961 speech:

<blockquote>
“In our glorious fight for civil rights, we must guard against being fooled by false 
slogans, such as ‘right to work.’ It is a law to rob us of our civil rights and job 
rights. Its purpose is to destroy labor unions and the freedom of collective bargaining 
by which unions have improved wages and working conditions of everyone. Wherever these 
laws have been passed, wages are lower, job opportunities are fewer and there are no 
civil rights. We do not intend to let them do this to us. We demand this fraud be 
stopped. Our weapon is our vote.”
</blockquote>

King never lived to see the day that Taft-Hartley and “right to work for less” was 
overthrown and the American Dream could become more available to all working-class 
Americans; it still hasn’t happened, even though it’s been at the top of labor’s 
wish list for decades.

Chapter 4: Expanding the base of the middle class

Expanding the base of the middle class
The middle class was, until the 1970s, largely the province of single-wage-earning 
married white men and their families. Through the 1960s, following passage of the 
Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965, African Americans and 
other minorities who had previously been shut out of the professions and management 
positions, and even excluded from most unions, began to find new opportunities as the 
result of anti-discrimination legislation.

The legalization of the birth control pill in 1961, and the nationwide legalization of 
birth control in 1965 with the Supreme Court’s Griswold decision, similarly brought a 
wave of women into the workforce. Women could now delay childbearing and plan for their 
futures, giving them access to more educational and economic opportunities.

When Sandra Day O’Connor graduated from law school in 1953, number 3 in her class 
academically, the only job she could find in the private sector was as a legal 
secretary.[lii] By the 1970s things had begun to change substantially.

In 1960, for example, fully 94 percent of all medical doctors in America were white 
men. By 2010, that number had dropped to 60 percent, as women and minorities gained 
admittance to medical school and made their way into careers as physicians.

As researchers from the University of Chicago and Stanford found and laid out in an 
in-depth paper published in 2019:

“We find that one-fifth of U.S. market GDP growth can be explained by falling labor 
market barriers, falling human capital barriers, and shifting occupational preferences. 
Much of the productivity gains come from drawing women and black men into high-skilled 
occupations.”

In political terms, this has very much been a two-edged sword.

While expanding the number of people who can enter the better-paid parts of the job 
market has increased the efficiency and fairness of our labor markets — and, thus, the 
overall efficiency and fairness of our entire society — it’s also provided a ready foil 
for Republicans to claim conspiracy and victimhood.

As mentioned elsewhere, the American middle class peaked at about two-thirds of us just 
as Ronald Reagan was taking office and his neoliberal Reaganomics policies were first 
put into place. Between his war on labor unions, offshoring our factories, and his 
cutting income tax rates (more on that in a bit), Reagan’s policies — kept in place for 
over 40 years now — have succeeded in so gutting the middle class that today only 43 
percent of Americans qualify as middle class. To make matters worse, today it takes 
two full-time incomes to achieve the lifestyle a single union job could provide in 
1981.[liii]

Most Americans — particularly those old enough to remember the middle class of the 1950s 
through the 1980s era — know this. They may not know the details, and they certainly 
don’t know the causes, but they know for a fact they’ve been screwed by government and 
corporate policies over the past 40-plus years.

But as largely Republican policies (Clinton and Obama both also bought into 
neoliberalism, as I lay out in detail in The Hidden History of Neoliberalism, but 
these ideas began with Reagan and the GOP) have cut the number of good jobs available 
to working class white men, Republican politicians have stepped up to offer those now-
impoverished white workers a ready boogeyman, complete with a simplistic explanation 
for their plight.

They tell their voters with a straight face: “It’s all because Blacks, Hispanics, and 
women have entered the job market! We need to return to the exclusionary policies of 
the 1950s!”

In fact, the entry of women and minorities previously excluded from good jobs has 
increased American productivity and the general prosperity of the nation. That worker-
driven productivity, however, has barely kept pace with an expanding economy, as 
Florida painfully learned in 2023 when Governor Ron DeSantis signed a draconian law 
heavily criminalizing undocumented immigrants and many fled the state.[liv] When 
Hurricane Idalia, fueled to super-storm status by global warming, hit the state and 
destroyed tens of thousands of homes and businesses, the price of labor to rebuild 
went through the roof — and often there simply were no workers to be found at any 
price — as a result.[lv]

Decades of Republicans and rightwing media hammering on the argument that the crisis 
of the American middle class was caused by women and people of color has led to a near-
hysteria around US immigration policies, particularly around our southern border.

Conservative talk-show host Lou Dobbs and others relentlessly amplified the message, 
encouraging Texas Governor Greg Abbott to intensify his war against border crossers. 
Abbott had the banks of the Rio Grande lined with miles of razor wire and installed a 
floating barrier in the river, endangering the lives of numerous migrants and asylum 
seekers. Abbott’s sadistic tactics have been linked to the drowning deaths of several 
migrants, including children.[lvi] White supremacist militias run “training operations” 
on the southern border, and white supremacist Republican politicians make regular 
pilgrimages there to stage photo-ops and press conferences about the supposed 
“invasion” of brown-skinned people.

While it’s true — and a canard repeated ad infinitum on conservative media — that, for 
example, new home construction used to be a well-paid job that could lift a white 
worker into the middle class and that labor is now widely done by Hispanic immigrants, 
it’s not because of any kind of “invasion.” Instead, it’s because labor unions once 
prevented non-citizens from entry into their ranks and construction labor — once 
heavily unionized — was one of the industries hardest hit by Reagan’s war on organized 
labor.

As Red states, one after the other, adopted so-called “right to work” laws (I call them 
“right to work for less” laws) contractors and other employers in those states shed 
their labor unions. With them went good pay and benefits, leaving what are essentially 
entry-level jobs that only recent immigrants are willing to do for the poor pay and 
lack of benefits now being offered.
