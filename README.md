<h2>Has Trump heralded a new “gilded age?” What comes next? Like Gatsby’s 1925 West </h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Egg mansion — stuffed with opulence but rotting underneath — Trump’s America is 
plunging headlong into a new Gilded Age, this time gilded not with gold but with grift. The 
signs are everywhere. There’s the multimillion-dollar White House ballroom Trump wants 
built for his private fundraising galas, while federal workers go without raises. There’s the 
Qatari luxury jet/bribe gifted to him — worth hundreds of millions — that Senate Republicans 
just voted to let him keep after leaving office, even after the Pentagon diverted nearly a 
billion dollars from a nuclear weapons maintenance program to refurbish it. And while 
billionaires hoard wealth and party with their wannabe king, a chilling jobs report has 
reminded the rest of us just how fragile the working class has become in this deregulated, 
union-busting, trickle-down circus. (Trump just fired the woman in charge of the agency 
that compiled the statistics because he doesn’t like the numbers; nobody in the world will 
trust future employment numbers out of this administration.) Like in Fitzgerald’s The Great 
Gatsby, this isn’t sustainable. The first Gilded Age — also birthed by Republican policies 
— collapsed into the Republican Great Depression. If history is any guide, this one will, too. 
Trump has built a country of spectacle and showmanship, where glitter masks decay and 
inequality reigns supreme. But even the most gold-plated illusions eventually crack. The 
question is: will we stop it before the crash, or let this corrupt spectacle drag us into a 
second Republican Great Depression like The Fourth Turning predicts?

<h2>GOP lawmaker runs into a buzzsaw at town hall</h2>
Republicans showing up in public to 
defend their and Trump’s obscene behavior is becoming like trying to defy gravity; it rarely 
works out well. Mike Johnson knows this, which is why he won’t do town halls and he’s 
advised all the other Republicans to likewise avoid contact with the dirty public (but keep 
up the big-bucks dinners with lobbyists and donors). Wisconsin Republican Congressman 
Brian Stiel thought he could pull it off, and was quickly set straight. While about 50 presumably 
Democratic protesters showed up outside the venue, inside the presumably Republican 
constituents of Stiel’s were having none of his BS. He tried to defend ICE wearing masks and 
was booed down. Same thing happened when he said it was important for Republicans to have 
cut Medicaid with the Big Ugly Bill. One voter called him an “embarrassment,” another said, 
“You’re not the right fit for us anymore,” and a third said: “I am so disappointed in how you 
represent us as the citizen of Walworth County. Southeast Wisconsin has not been represented 
by you. President Trump seems to run southeast Wisconsin through you.” While Stiel thought 
he could defy political gravity, it didn’t work; this is another example showing there’s a good 
chance for Republicans to get wiped out in the ’26 elections, which, of course, is why they’re so 
vigorously trying to gerrymander Red states and purge millions of voters from the rolls in Blue 
cities. Will it work? Will Gavin Newsom call a special election to redraw California’s maps? Will 
other Democratic states follow Illinois Governor JB Pritzker’s advice to “fight gerrymandering 
fire with fire” and Congressman and Progressive Caucus President Emeritus Mark Pocan’s 
advice for Blue states to begin their own voter purges? Stay tuned…

— First it was Nazi salutes; now Elon wants you to know that “women are built to be traded.” 
Seriously. Check this out; it sorta speaks for itself and tells you everything you never wanted to 
know about this bizarre billionaire African immigrant who is now the GOP’s single largest donor:

— Trump wants the federal government to be able to track every one of your medical and health 
issues in real time, and Big Tech is all excited about being able to get their hands on your private 
data. Georgetown University law professor who specializes in public health, Lawrence Gostin, 
noted, “There are enormous ethical and legal concerns. Patients across America should be very 
worried that their medical records are going to be used in ways that harm them and their families.” 
The Associated Press reports: “More than 60 companies, including major tech companies like 
Google, Amazon and Apple as well as health care giants like UnitedHealth Group and CVS Health, 
have agreed to share patient data in the system.” Just what we all needed, right? These guys 
snooping into our private medical information and then sharing it all with Trump, Noem, Bondi, 
and ICE…

— Trump is threatening other countries with steep tariffs if they don’t change their sovereign 
foreign policy decisions. The Constitution says only Congress can impose tariffs; it’s unambiguous. 
The Emergency Powers Act that Trump is citing as justification for his imposing unilateral tariffs 
doesn’t even mention the word “tariffs.” What he’s doing is entirely illegal and no business is going 
to build a factory here just because Trump threw up a tariff when they know he could (and probably 
will) change his mind next month or the next president — or a future Congress or the Supreme Court 
— can cancel his tariffs. That’s why Trump’s tariffs are not only screwing up America’s standing in 
the world but also taking a hammer to our economy. But now he’s using them as punishments; in 
this case, going after Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney for saying that he’d support a Palestinian 
state. Felon Trump and accused felon Netanyahu want nothing to do with that, so Trump’s saying he’s 
going to hit Canada — or, more correctly, he’s going to hit American consumers of Canadian goods — 
with a 35% tariff. This is nuts and, as I mentioned yesterday, he’s only doing it because it forces 
leaders of countries around the world to come grovel before him the way he’d always hoped the guys 
on Wall Street and in New York high society would do (but they refused). Trump’s fragile ego has 
become a wrecking ball that threatens a second Republican Great Depression. Buckle up…

— Where are the 4,725 Epstein wire transfers that Trump, Noem, and Bondi are hiding? That’s the 
question my senator, Ron Wyden, wants answers to. He’s unearthed proof that the details of the 
cash movements totaling over a billion dollars are in the possession of the Trump administration, 
but they’re not only refusing to release them, they won’t even acknowledge Wyden’s demand for 
transparency. It could, after all, blow open the entire underage sex-trafficking business Epstein was 
running out of his two homes, each just down the street from his “best friend” Trump’s homes in New 
York City and Palm Beach. We also learned yesterday that the DOJ has been going through the 
Epstein documents and redacting anything that has to do with Trump. Meanwhile, in what’s almost 
certainly the down payment in the deal Trump’s criminal defense lawyer Todd Blanche worked out 
with her, Ghislaine Maxwell was moved yesterday from a real women’s prison in Florida to a 
“minimum security facility” in Texas that’s more like a women’s sorority house. This is particularly 
odd since it’s against the law as Allison Gill notes: you can’t put sex offenders into minimum security 
facilities (because they could represent a threat to the other inmates; the same reason there are no 
violent offenders there). Somebody waived that rule — or Blanche/Noem/Bondi/Trump are ignoring it 
— and the media’s not even asking who or why. The big question now is whether Trump’s base will 
accept it (Fox already has) when the coverup is complete, Maxwell testifies that he had nothing to 
do with underage girls but Bill Clinton was sure there, and Trump declares “total transparency.” I’m 
betting, reluctantly, that they will and it’ll all blow over by November, but with this case it’s impossible 
to know for sure.

— Geeky Science! There was a mass die off of Monarch butterflies is 2024 and we now know why. 
Over 90 percent of Monarch butterflies that were common across North America just 50 years ago are 
gone, and there was another mass die-off at a California over-wintering site last December. Up until 
now, nobody has known for sure what’s killing the insects; the main suspects have been pesticides, 
climate change, and loss of habitat to development. So a plucky group of scientists visited the mass 
death site and autopsied a bunch of the Monarchs; most had as many as 7 different pesticides in their 
bodies, all at lethal levels. We have to stop using these deadly chemicals (that aren’t good for us, either!) 
and return to sustainable agriculture practices. Roundup, for example, is known to cause cancer in 
humans and dogs, but the last Trump administration said they could ditch the warning labels. You can 
kill weeds with high-strength vinegar, and Neem oil is a great insecticide; there are lots of natural 
alternatives to the chemicals that are applied both commercially and in residential environments and 
we should all use them, encourage our HOAs and neighbors to use them, and push our politicians to 
get the EPA back on the job.

Yes, We’re the Villains Now — And It’s About to Get Worse
Will any Republican in today’s House or Senate — the bodies the Founders created — 
find even a fraction of the courage of the men who founded this nation?


Former Republican Congressman Adam Kinsinger asks a question no current Republican 
politician appears willing to say out loud for fear that Musk, Trump, or other rightwing 
billionaires will use the corrupt Citizens United decision to blow them out of the water 
politically with a multimillion-dollar primary challenge:

“[A]s I watch the behavior of our political leaders, the comments of an ever-increasingly 
unhinged Trump, and the growing indifference of many Americans toward our role in the 
world, I have to ask a painful question: Are we now the bad guys?”

It’s a helluva question.

Our nation’s Founders overthrew a king in 1776, and paid a huge price for it. Altogether, 
seventeen of the fifty-six signers of the Declaration of Independence were wiped out by 
the war they declared.

The signers wrote in the Declaration, “we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our 
Fortunes and our sacred Honor,” and it was a simple statement of fact. The day they 
signed that document, each legally became a traitor and was sentenced to death for 
treason by the ruler who controlled their lands and their homes.

One the wealthiest of the signers was Thomas Nelson of Virginia, but a year after the 
signing the British had seized his home and lands. When he and George Washington 
attacked the British in Nelson’s hometown, Nelson encouraged Washington to attack the 
Nelson homestead, which British General Cornwallis had taken as his headquarters, with 
cannons. The house was destroyed, and after the war Nelson, unable to repay loans he’d 
taken out against it to help finance the Revolution, lost his property; he died in poverty at 
the age of 50.

The wealthy Philadelphia merchant, Robert Morris, lost 150 ships at sea in the war, wiping 
out his small fortune; he died destitute. Signer William Ellery of Rhode Island similarly lost e
verything, as did Virginia’s Carter Braxton and Benjamin Harrison, Pennsylvania’s George 
Clymer, New York’s Philip Livingston, Georgia’s Lyman Hall, and New Jersey’s Francis 
Hopkinson.

The British destroyed New York’s Francis Lewis’ property and threw his wife into such a 
hellhole of a jail that she died two years later. Three of South Carolina’s four signers — 
Edward Rutledge, Thomas Heyward, Jr., and Arthur Middleton — were captured by the 
British and held in a filthy, unheated prison and brutally tortured for a year before George 
Washington freed them in a prisoner exchange.

New Jersey farmer John Hart’s wife died shortly after he signed the Declaration, and his 
thirteen children were scattered among sympathetic families to hide them from the British 
and conservative loyalists. He never saw them again, dying alone and wracked with grief 
three years later.

New Jersey State Supreme Court Justice Richard Stockton took his wife and children into 
hiding after he signed the Declaration, but conservatives loyal to the crown turned them in. 
He was so badly beaten and starved in the British prison that he died before the war was 
over. His home was looted, and his wife and children lived the rest of their lives as paupers.

Altogether, nine of the men in that room died and four lost their children as a direct result 
of putting their names to the Declaration of Independence. Every single one had to flee 
his home, and, after the war, twelve returned to find only rubble.

They were all willing to fight and die for the idea of democracy in America. Every one of them.

And now, after 236 years of existence — as Donald Trump bows to Putin and tweets a picture 
of himself cosplaying king in a gold crown — America is on the verge of becoming an entirely 
different type of nation.

We’ve always (or nearly always) been on the side of democracies. We fought against fascists 
in World War II and defeated them. We helped create democratic alliances in Europe and Asia; 
we led the fight to create the United Nations.

And now we’re joining Russia. This century’s dictatorial, imperial power.

Monday will be the third anniversary of Putin’s brutal invasion and rape of Ukraine. When he was 
a US Senator, Marco Rubio said:

“Vladimir Putin is an authoritarian thug who is accountable to no one. … I don’t think what Vladimir 
Putin exhibits is leadership: I think what he exhibits is thuggery … and we should be clear-eyed 
about that. … At the end of the day, Hillary Clinton was part of the single biggest blunder ever 
when it came to Vladimir Putin, and that’s the reset with Russia.”

Today, Lil’ Marco is talking about “incredible [investment] opportunities” for American billionaires 
and US corporations who want to do business with Russia.

Just five months ago, Republican Senator Lindsay Graham stood with Ukrainian President 
Zelenskyy in Washington, DC and said, “You’re the best kind of ally. You fight the Russians 
so we don’t have to.”

Today, Graham — like every other Republican senator and House member except Thom Tillis 
— has been cowed into a terrified impotence, unwilling to do anything to stop or block America’s 
new dictator-friendly democracy-hostile foreign policy.

Our military is being purged along hard-right ideological lines, as was the Department of Justice; 
the FBI is next on the firing line, although reports suggest that purge began weeks ago.

Virtually every major government agency is under attack by the DOGE hackers, as the America 
government is being crippled; Putin is no doubt delighted.

Even our defense budget is scheduled to be cut with a chainsaw, just as the threat from Russia 
and China is at the highest point in our lifetimes.

They shut down children’s cancer research, Alzheimer’s research, and food and drugs for 
the world’s poorest people. They are laying off FAA employees at the same time planes 
are falling out of the sky. They’re gutting the staff that processes your Social Security, 
tax, and Medicare payments.

Trump and his MAGA crowd are tearing our government apart, apparently with the goal of 
replacing it with something quite different than America has ever experienced before.

An entirely new America. A royal America. An America of, by, and for the morbidly rich.

One that resembles the vision petrobillionaire David Koch laid out in 1980 when he ran for 
Vice President on a platform calling for the destruction of nearly every federal agency 
except the Pentagon and the end of all income taxes on billionaires.

A country that will bear a little resemblance to that grand idea our Founders fought and 
died for.

And they’re doing it as fast as they can — dismantling our country, our democracy, and 
realigning our foreign policy — because they know once Americans catch on we will rise 
up and try to stop them.

America’s media and our free speech rights are under ideological attack, with every major 
television network having been sued for millions; one has already capitulated. A Substack 
newsletter writer was sued for millions by the new FBI Director. Trump even sued a small 
Iowa newspaper and their pollster because they offended him.

Both Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer and Congressman Robert Garcia have been 
threatened with investigation and imprisonment by a US attorney for their comments 
about abortion and politics, despite the Constitution protecting members of Congress 
from such intimidation. Schumer apologized on the floor of the Senate for saying of 
SCOTUS justices’ anti-abortion Dobbs decision, “You have released the whirlwind and 
you will pay the price”; Garcia is defiant.

Republicans could stop this, if they will just find their spine. Every soldier in the American 
military is willing to die for their country on a moment’s notice, every single one, but elected 
Republicans — who are supposed to have the courage to make decisions about war and 
peace — won’t even raise their hands or lift their voices.

History will not treat this GOP well.

And to add insult to injury, this week Trump took down the agency that protects our elections 
from foreign interference. The same sort of influence that may well have put Trump into the 
White House in the first place.

As The New York Times noted in an article titled “Trump Dismantles Government Fight 
Against Foreign Influence Operations”:

“Experts are alarmed that the cuts could leave the United States defenseless against 
covert foreign influence operations and embolden foreign adversaries seeking to disrupt 
democratic governments.”

Putin’s been playing Trump for a sucker since, apparently, 2017. That was when Trump’s 
then-National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster said the president had a secret, private 
meeting with Putin. McMaster tried to warn Trump about Putin but, he wrote in his memoir:

“Putin, a ruthless former KGB operator, played to Trump’s ego and insecurities with flattery. …

“I told Trump how Putin had duped Bush and Obama. ‘Mr President, he is the best liar in 
the world.’ I suggested that Putin was confident he could ‘play’ Trump and get what he 
wanted, sanctions relief and the US out of Syria and Afghanistan on the cheap, by 
manipulating Trump with ambiguous promises of a ‘better relationship’. He would offer 
cooperation on counterterrorism, cybersecurity and arms control.

“I could tell that Trump was getting impatient with my ‘negative vibe’. I said what I 
needed to say. If he was going to be contrary, I hoped he would be contrary to the 
Russian dictator, not to me.”

Yet here we are today, with Trump realigning America toward Putin and away from the 
democratic republic of Ukraine and the rest of democratic Europe.

As a result, Russia’s next step is to wait until Ukraine runs out of American air defense 
systems and then just start bombing the crap out of Ukrainian cities. Millions could die 
and it could lead to World War III, but that seems just fine with Trump.

And, apparently, that’s just fine with every Republican Senator and Congress member 
except Tillis. America is on the verge of becoming the world’s newest thug nation ruled 
by fabulously wealthy oligarchs and a man who would be king.

Thus, sadly, the answer to Congressman Kinsinger’s question is clear: Yes, we are now 
the bad guys, at least for the moment. We are now on the side of the royal ideology of 
absolute power held by that one man, the King, whose soldiers imprisoned, tortured, and 
murdered so many of our nation’s Founders.

When Rhode Island’s Stephen Hopkins signed the Declaration of Independence, he remarked 
to his friend William Ellery that, “My hand trembles, but my heart does not.” But Virginia’s 
Benjamin Harrison, who weighed nearly 300 pounds, commented to Massachusetts’ Elbridge 
Gerry, a short, thin man, “With me it [the hanging] will all be over in a minute, but you will be 
dancing on air an hour after I am gone.”

Will any Republican in today’s House or Senate — the bodies those men created — find even 
a fraction of the courage of those who founded this nation?

The people of America — and the world — are holding their breath, waiting for the answer.


<h2>Death Rattle of a Cult: Trump, Epstein, and the Long Knives of the Right...</h2>

Elon Musk is probably chuckling as Trump flails; today’s firestorm around the Epstein 
documents arguably started when he tweeted that Trump was in the files. Which has led to 
some significant changes in the Trump/media/politics/deep-state landscape that it’s 
important to review. They include questions about the future of Trump, his cult followers, a 
possible power struggle between Trump and Murdoch, and JD Vance’s Presidential ambitions.

To begin: if you want everything around the Epstein furor to make sense, all you have to 
understand is that Donald Trump has been leading a cult.

Like Jim Jones did. Like Charles Manson did. Like Rajneesh did here in Oregon. Unlike 
Manson, but more like Rajneesh and Jim Jones, however, Trump’s cult is fairly large and 
preexisted his appearance on the scene. And that’s part of his problem.

It’s large enough to have in it three kinds of people.

The first kind of person is the “true believer.” They make up most of the Trump cult members, 
what we call MAGA. They’re usually pretty much willing to overlook anything Dear Leader does, 
much like the devoted followers of Rajaneesh and Jim Jones.

And then there are the “facilitators.” These are cynical people who don’t believe the cult 
leader’s BS, but go along with it — and even promote it — because it works to their 
benefit. They are typically parasitic. They usually make their money from the members 
of the cult, or get power from them (votes in this case), and often use their position in 
the cult to gain other benefits like sexual favors or fame.

In this case the facilitators are the Republican politicians who are begging money from 
their followers and voters, and then vote to screw those followers on behalf of the cult 
leader — Trump — and his billionaire friends. The morbidly rich keep the cult facilitators 
in line by funding their elections and, in the case of Republican Supreme Court justices, 
their lavish lifestyles.

When you understand that it’s a cult and that some of the people who seem high-up in it are true 
believers and not facilitators, suddenly Marjorie Taylor Greene’s behavior makes sense when she 
seems to attack Trump: she’s a true believer. She’s completely bought into the conspiracy nuttery 
that brought him to office twice.

You also begin to understand why Chuck Grassley ran that Senate judiciary committee the way 
he did to push through Emil Bove over the objections of the Democrats and literally hundreds of 
former lawyers, judges, and Department of Justice officials: Grassley is a cynical facilitator.

And you understand why the Republican Congressman from Kentucky, Thomas Massey, has 
joined with Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna to demand release of the Epstein documents 
and essentially turned on Trump.

Massey represents the third kind of person in a cult, who only shows up typically toward 
the early stages of the collapse of the cult, and then presents a real danger to the cult leader.

This third category are “the true believers who have suddenly seen a crack in reality,” the 
false reality that the cult leader has created around them. You could call them “former 
true believers.” Once they saw the light through that crack — saw the real world — they 
realized that they were being lied to.

When a cult is on the verge of collapse, these kinds of people become more and more 
numerous as more and more people begin to wake up from the cult leader’s trance.

At that point, they turn on the cult leader the way a spurned lover turns on the previous 
object of their affection. They become angry and vengeful. They demand answers. They 
want to know how they got sucked in and why: “Who did this to me? And to whose benefit?”

This is how Donald Trump’s world is disintegrating right now, and the danger is that, like 
Jim Jones, Charles Manson, and Rajaneesh, he may destroy a lot of lives when he goes down.

He may not kill them like Jim Jones did — although he already arguably killed a half-million 
of his cult followers with the malicious, incompetent way he handled Covid — but he will 
destroy many of the people and institutions around him. This is what narcissists do when 
they begin to psychologically collapse.

As I noted two weeks ago, my late friend Armin Lehmann was there when he gave Hitler the 
information that the war was lost. He stood outside Hitler’s door when he shot himself. He 
wrote a book about it, and told me that Hitler wanted Germany destroyed by the Allies 
because the German people, he believed, had “let him down.”

This is “narcissistic collapse,” which I’ve written about several times over the past dozen 
or so years. Donald Trump is almost certainly going to hit this state of mind (he’s already 
close), and many of his “true believer” followers are in the midst of their own personal 
narcissistic collapses right now.

And that is what makes this a very dangerous moment for America.

Suing Rupert Murdoch, for example, was an extraordinarily reckless and dangerous thing 
for Trump to do. Newscorp isn’t going to roll over and pay Trump a bribe, in all probability, 
because he needs them more than they need him.

Murdoch, after all, is the guy who created the cult that Trump has come to dominate: they’re 
called “Fox News viewers.” He created it long before Donald Trump came along: he and Roger 
Ailes simply let Donald Trump into it back in 2015 because he was good for ratings and thus 
increased profits.

So, once Murdoch decided that Donald Trump could benefit his cult and make money for his 
television network (and even lower his taxes), he let Donald believe that he was the leader of 
the cult. And for many people in that Fox “News” Viewer cult, Trump actually did become the 
leader.

But the real guy who controls the cult is Rupert Murdoch. It’s not Donald Trump. Trump is just 
today’s figurehead. Sort of like with the Catholic Church, Trump is the pope right now. But when 
the pope goes, he gets replaced.

The institution lives on, and you can bet your bottom dollar that the Murdoch family is not going 
to let the cult that they’ve built with Fox “News,” the cult that has made them billions of dollars 
and given them the power to influence governments on three continents, dissolve.

They’ll jettison Donald Trump long before they’ll let go of that kind of power.

The way Rupert Murdoch’s father Sir Keith Murdoch first created this cult back in the 1940s was by 
feeding the readers of his newspapers in Australia a steady diet of racist outrage, fear, and anger. 
As historian John C. McManus writes in his definitive book Fire and Fortitude: The US Army in the 
Pacific War, 1941-1943:

“As American soldiers began arriving in numbers during the early months of 1942, they were greeted 
with tremendous enthusiasm by the Australians, many of whom couldn’t hide their immense relief at 
the soothing presence of the GIs. … Appreciative crowds gathered at piers and station platforms to 
greet incoming ships and troop trains. Waving and cheering, they studied the newcomers with great 
curiosity.”

But Sir Keith Murdoch thought he could make a pile of money by turning Australians against 
Americans. Inflaming nationalist and xenophobic sentiments would sell papers, goose advertising, 
and make him rich.

Thus, as McManus documents:

“A chain of newspapers owned by Sir Keith Murdoch, father of latter-year media magnate Rupert 
Murdoch, earned a reputation among the yanks as relentlessly anti-American. Truth, a particularly 
brassy Melbourne tabloid, often published lurid tales of GI rapes of innocent Australian girls and 
seduction of married women.

“On occasion, Australian soldiers vented their frustration over such tales with violence. Small 
groups of Diggers roamed around some of the cities, beating up any American soldiers whom 
they saw dating local girls. … An American soldier was even shot and killed one morning as he 
emerged from the house of a married woman.”

Eventually, the hate against Americans that Murdoch had stirred up blossomed into full-fledged 
riots in multiple Australian cities, creating a real problem for the war effort but boosting Murdoch’s 
newspaper sales (and, presumably, profits) into the stratosphere as his papers developed their 
own cult following in Oz.

Keith then passed the cult and the media outlets that had created it along to Rupert, who 
then took his brand of cult-forming “journalism” (Fox called it “entertainment” when they 
were sued by Dominion Voting Systems) to England and then, ironically, to America.

By definition, people who live in a cult live in an unreality. A fictitious world. That’s 
the key to how the cult and its leaders control them: they convince the cult members 
that they’re the only ones who truly understand how the world works, that they have 
“secret knowledge,” and that everyone outside the cult is either blind, evil, or both.

This creates an us-versus-them narrative so powerful it replaces facts, isolates them 
from reality, and makes loyalty to the cult and its perceived leader more important 
than truth itself.

People who watch Fox “News,” for example, believe that what they hear on NPR is “liberal 
propaganda,” which is why they support defunding public broadcasting. What they actually 
hear on public broadcasting, however, is just the news. It reflects reality. Actual reality. 
But they think it’s liberal propaganda because their cult told them so.

In much the same way Jim Jones’ followers and Charles Manson’s followers didn’t listen 
to their friends when they tried to share reality with them or point out how they had been 
indoctrinated, brainwashed, and lied to, the people in the Fox “News” cult don’t want to 
listen to reality. They want the comfortable lies and the excuses for hate and outrage 
that they have wrapped themselves in for years.

Murdoch now has to make a tough decision. He’s already gotten most of what he needed from 
Trump — a massive tax break for himself and his family, and deregulation of the broadcast 
and internet space — so he only needs Trump now because Donald makes for good television.

But “good television” can work two ways for a public official, for or against them. If Trump 
has sufficiently pissed off Murdoch, or he thinks that Trump’s beginning to harm the GOP 
and thus the cult that the Murdoch family and their well-paid talent largely control, he could 
give Trump the old heave-ho.

So if Trump gets thrown out of the Fox “News” Viewer cult — essentially gets fired as the 
cult leader — the cult will continue. It would simply lose a very small percentage of its 
hard-core true believers who’d completely surrendered their personalities to Trump, and 
even those folks are probably retrievable.

The problem for Murdoch and other facilitators of the Fox “News” Viewer cult that Trump 
now leads is who will fill the vacuum that’ll be created when Trump is gone, whether it’s 
from natural causes or an impeachment or 25th Amendment action that Murdoch and Fox 
could provoke. Who will continue to defend the interests of the morbidly rich and the 
monopolistic parts of corporate America and become the next leader of the GOP?

JD Vance is unlikely to be able to fill Trump’s shoes, which has to be giving Murdoch 
heartburn. Vance has virtually no hold at all on the Fox “News” Viewer cult that Trump 
today dominates.

He is not beloved by the cult; if anything they think of him as weak and effeminate. He 
uses eyeliner. He married a brown-skinned woman and has brown-skin children. His wife 
refuses to adopt Christianity.

“He must be weak,” is the consensus across much of the white racist base that constitutes 
the MAGA-sphere.

Nonetheless, Vance himself apparently thinks he can take over for Donald. He’s deluding 
himself, of course, but he appears to believe it. Just look at how he just publicly demanded 
that Donald Trump’s “artwork” be released by the Wall Street Journal or the FBI.

He knows a release of more damaging evidence of Trump’s long-term relationship with 
Epstein — and thus, in the minds of the cult followers, participation in the deep state 
conspiracy that exploits children while it runs the world — could inflict incredible damage 
on Trump, and even make Vance president.

What man who believes destiny and God want him to become president wouldn’t jump at 
something like that? Remember, JD Vance said the following about Donald Trump:

“I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon… or that he’s 
America’s Hitler.”

“[Trump is] a disaster and a bad man. A morally reprehensible human being.”

“Fellow Christians, everyone is watching us when we apologize for this man.”

Vance understood the cult even before he cynically pretended he was part of it when he 
saw Trump was prevailing: like most other Republican politicians and the billionaires who 
fund them, he’s an exploiter, a cult “facilitator.”

It’s extremely unlikely, however, that he’ll ever become the leader of the Fox Viewer cult; 
it’s unlikely, in fact, that the subset of the Fox cult that has formed around Trump will 
survive as Trump followers.

As John Hobbes famously said, “Men heap together the mistakes of their lives and create 
a monster they call destiny.” With the Epstein revelations turning into a torrent, that’s now 
the story of Donald John Trump.

When Trump is gone — and that day will eventually come — his corner of the Fox “News” 
Viewer cult will most likely shatter back into dozens of smaller organizations, many of 
which will simply be returning to their roots: Proud Boys, Three Percenters, anti-abortion 
freaks, rightwing preachers hustling their congregations, etc.

After all, as Maureen Dowd points out, Trump has now become the deep state he once 
decried. He’s creating the very “FEMA Camps” that had Republicans and Fox “News” 
Viewer cult members hysterical when Obama was president.

He’s developing a masked, anonymous, unaccountable nationwide secret police force and 
is compiling massive amounts of intelligence on everyday Americans. Between his spy 
agencies and data brokers, he has access to anybody’s social media posts, emails, and 
medical and travel records. He’s given ICE full and unfettered access to everybody’s 
Medicaid and other government records.

If rightwingers keep protesting him or demanding more information about Jeffrey Epstein, 
they will be next in his crosshairs and that could begin the final stage of his participation 
in the Fox “News” Viewer cult. He’s already called them stupid, hysterical, and told them 
they’re dupes for the Democrats, claiming he no longer wants their support.

Thus, we stand very close to what may be a true crossroads moment for America.

If Trump survives this politically, he’ll most likely begin a serious crackdown modeled 
after the June, 1934 Night of the Long Knives (albeit probably less bloody), purging his 
opposition within his own ranks much like Putin did a decade ago in Russia and Orbán 
is doing now in Hungary. It’ll further damage American democracy and make it much 
harder for us to recover our previous New Deal and Great Society political and economic 
systems.

On the other hand, if Trump goes down in flames and Vance, Johnson, Cruz, or somebody 
equally weak tries to step in and take over the cult, it could spell doom for the GOP for a 
generation.

So get out the popcorn, but maybe you should also have something a little more defensive 
than that. Get ready. It’s gonna be a rough ride, but in all probability we’ll make it through 
without the kind of damage that Germany or the people at Jonestown suffered.

Wish us all luck. We need it — and citizen activism — now more than ever before.

The Coming Republican Depression: How the GOP Turned America Into a Powder Keg, 
and Is About to Light the Match

Housing bubbles, financial scams, and political sabotage are converging into a historic, 
preventable disaster.


epublicans may be fixing to crash the economy again — Republican presidents oversaw 
10 of the last 11 recessions and the Republican Great Depression — and they’re doing it 
to satisfy the greed of the billionaires they serve.

Today, for example, is the day that some of Trump‘s worst tariffs are supposed to go into 
effect, and many folks on Wall Street are deciding where they want to hide when the ceiling 
starts falling in. The horrible jobs report just released hours ago highlights not only how 
bad things were in July, but they had to “revise downward by 285,000 jobs” previous 
reports; it looks like Trump’s people have been cooking the books.

The Financial Times is on it; they published an article this week titled, “The US economy 
is more fragile than it appears.” It’s author, Tej Parikh, points out that our housing market 
is in trouble and starting to look like it did around the time of the Bush Housing Crash in 
2008, that spending patterns are changing in alarming ways (my phrase, not his), and that 
both the labor and stock markets are vulnerable. The article is frankly alarming.

And former labor secretary Robert Reich titled his brilliant newsletter yesterday: “Be 
Warned: The Financial Bubble Will Soon Burst.” The former Clinton cabinet member 
writes:

“The financial economy — stocks, bonds, and their derivatives — is in for a big reality 
check, and I think it will happen soon.”

America has stared into this abyss before; three times, in fact. In the 1770s, a brutal 
financial crisis driven by colonial overextension, monopolistic control by the British 
East India Company, and political corruption helped spark the American Revolution. In 
the 1850s, it was wildcat banking, land speculation, and a collapse in trust that helped 
produce the Panic of 1857 and push the nation toward civil war. And in 1929, Republican 
deregulation, tax cuts for the rich, financial speculation, and an all-out assault on labor 
exploded into the Republican Great Depression.

Today, every one of the fuse lines that set off those explosions is once again being laid 
by a Republican president and Party that has abandoned any pretense of economic 
stewardship or patriotism.

They are actively destabilizing the pillars of our economy, undermining our democracy, 
and gutting the social contract that held us together for nearly a century. And unless we a
ct — forcefully, quickly, and collectively — we may soon experience a collapse that makes 
2008 look like a speed bump.

The risk of a modern economic depression is not academic or merely theoretical. It’s also 
not fearmongering. It is real, it is avoidable, and it is being amplified by a political 
movement that openly disdains regulation, despises democracy, and seeks to roll back 
every gain the American middle class has made since FDR dragged this country out of 
the last Republican-created catastrophe.

We are now living under a Republican president whose party has:

— Repeatedly held the full faith and credit of the United States hostage in debt ceiling 
standoffs designed to force cruel cuts to programs that serve ordinary people;

— Demanded the Fed lower interest rates in a way that could push the nation into an 
inflationary spiral even as wages stagnate and housing becomes unaffordable for the 
bottom 90%;

— Pushed for the end of regulations on banks, fossil fuel companies, tech monopolies, and 
Wall Street speculators, even as their recklessness increases systemic risk;

— Championed massive tax cuts for billionaires and multinational corporations, ballooning 
the deficit while cutting benefits and raising taxes on working people;

— Enabled trade wars and supply chain disruptions while cutting support for green 
manufacturing and public investment;

— Promoted and made billions from crypto;

— And perhaps most grotesquely, embraced open authoritarianism and white nationalism, 
eroding the rule of law and the very stability on which economic confidence depends.

Every one of these moves destabilizes the foundation of modern prosperity. And every one of 
them echoes the warning signs of past collapses. The mechanisms of economic catastrophe 
are not mysterious. We’ve seen them before.

Start with sovereign debt and fiscal dysfunction.

In 2023 and 2024, House Republicans repeatedly brought us to the brink of default just to 
slash food aid, gut Medicaid, and kill green jobs. Now, in 2025, they’re salivating over a new 
“Balanced Budget Amendment” that would make countercyclical investment during recessions 
illegal. That’s economic suicide.

When demand collapses, the government must spend to stabilize the system. That’s Econ 
101. But the GOP wants a permanent austerity straitjacket. Why? Because billionaires don’t 
suffer in recessions: they buy everything at a discount and radically increase their own wealth 
when things rebound. For the morbidly rich, Republican recessions and depressions are 
“buying opportunities”: it’s class war, plain and simple.

Then there’s financial speculation and asset bubbles.

We’re once again living in an era of rampant unregulated financial engineering:
— Crypto Ponzi schemes.
— AI stock frenzies.
— Private equity gutting essential companies and loading them with debt.
— Trillions of dollars sloshing around the system chasing yield, while regulators like the 
SEC and FTC are neutered by courts stacked with right-wing ideologues.

Remember what happened in 1929? The same “let the market police itself” ideology brought 
the whole thing crashing down. The difference now is that the contagion would be global and 
could even be instantaneous.

Trade shocks and de-dollarization are looming risks, too.

Trump’s tariffs hurt American farmers and manufacturers. His talk of a new 10% universal 
tariff could ignite a global trade war and could push countries like China, Brazil, or Saudi 
Arabia to finally abandon the dollar as the reserve currency.

If that happens — if Treasury bonds stop being the world’s safe haven — we’re looking at 
a collapse in our ability to finance debt, a surge in interest rates, a crash in the housing 
market, and mass layoffs. And the Republicans? They cheer it on. They think chaos is 
good politics.

And then there are tariffs: there’s a reason the Founders of this country and Framers of 
the Constitution gave the power to enact tariffs exclusively to Congress. They knew that 
nobody would build a factory here unless they knew that a tariff defending their manufacturing 
would be in place for the decades it would take to recover their investment costs.

When tariffs are simply slapped here and there willy-nilly by a single man and can be 
easily repealed by the next president, no competent business manager would take them 
seriously: the only thing tariffs do, under these circumstances, is damage the economy. 
Meanwhile, Trump’s tariffs so far are going to cost the average American family $2,400 this year.

And, from Donald Trump’s point of view, they force foreign leaders to come grovel in front of 
him, which absolutely delights him. He brags about it, once noting that, “They are kissing my 
ass.” This is not trade policy; he’s just doing this for his ego.

And what about public confidence and how the loss of it could cause a depression?

You can’t have a functioning economy without trust in government, in institutions, in money 
itself. But the GOP has made destroying trust its central project.

They lie about elections. They undermine the courts. They spread conspiracy theories. 
They smear career civil servants. They openly praise authoritarianism.

When half the population no longer believes in the legitimacy of its own government, and 
when the other half sees that government captured by billionaires and zealots, economic 
confidence evaporates.

People stop spending. They stop investing. They retreat into cash and hoarding. That’s h
ow depressions spiral out of control.

Now layer on climate instability and its ability to wreck an economy and you have a real mess.

The GOP’s climate denialism is not just immoral, it’s economically suicidal. Hurricanes, 
wildfires, floods, and heat waves are destroying billions in assets every year.

Insurance markets are collapsing in California, Florida, and Louisiana. Agricultural yields 
are falling. Water shortages are hitting the Southwest. Floods are wiping out the Midwest 
and the South while wildfires torch the West. But Republicans keep slashing climate r
esearch, killing green energy subsidies, and banning ESG investment strategies. They 
are literally outlawing the future.

It’s a five-alarm fire, and the Republican arsonists are demanding more gasoline.

There is, however, a way out. We’ve done it before.

After the last Republican-created depression, Franklin Roosevelt rejected the dogma of 
austerity and implemented the most ambitious suite of Keynesian policies in world history. 
He put people to work. He regulated the banks. He taxed the rich. He unionized the 
workforce. He broke up monopolies. He guaranteed Social Security, unemployment 
insurance, and the right to organize.

That system — Keynesian demand-side economics — created the greatest middle class the 
world has ever seen. It lifted millions out of poverty, stabilized capitalism, and gave rise to the 
postwar economic boom. It literally created the modern American middle class.

But starting in 1981, Reagan and the GOP declared war on that system. They 
gutted antitrust enforcement. They slashed top tax rates. They crushed unions. 
They deregulated finance. They privatized public goods. They shifted the burden 
of funding government from the rich to the working class. And then they blamed 
the victims of their policies for the resulting inequality and instability.

Now they’re going for the kill shot.

Trump and his Republican Party are not just misguided; they are dangerous. Their 
policies are not just bad; they are existential threats to economic stability. They’ve 
created the conditions for collapse, and they’ll blame immigrants, Democrats, or 
queer kids when it happens.

We can’t let them. We have to take our country back, economically, politically, morally.

That means rejecting trickle-down nonsense and restoring Keynesian demand-side 
policies. It means breaking up monopolies and rebuilding a regulatory state that 
works. It means bringing back progressive taxation and closing loopholes for 
billionaires. It means massive investment in clean energy, public health, education, 
and infrastructure. It means rebuilding trust in democracy by reversing Citizens 
United, defending voting rights, rooting out corruption, and calling out fascism where we see it.

This must be at the core of the platform Democrats run on this fall and during next 
year’s midterms.

The risk of a depression is real. But the solution is in our hands. We just have to stop 
letting the Republican Party light the matches.
