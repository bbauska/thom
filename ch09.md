Housing should not be a commodity
The American Dream of owning your own home is the opposite of homelessness: housing 
is one of the primary essentials of life. A functioning society requires sufficient 
affordable housing, something that is more and more slipping away from Americans 
every day.

It seems that everywhere you look in America you see the tragedy of homelessness. 
Rarely, though, do you hear that Wall Street is helping cause it.

Thirty-two percent seems to be the magic threshold, according to new research funded 
by the real estate listing company Zillow.[cvii] When neighborhoods hit rent rates 
in excess of 32 percent of neighborhood income, homelessness explodes. And we’re 
seeing it play out right in front of us in cities across America because a handful 
of Wall Street billionaires want to make a killing.

Housing prices have gone out of control since my dad bought his house in 1957 
when I was six years old. He got a Veteran’s Administration-subsidized loan and 
picked up the brand-new 3-bedroom ranch house my brothers and I grew up in, in 
suburban south Lansing, Michigan. It cost him $13,000, which was about twice what 
he made every year working a good union job in a tool-and-die shop.

As mentioned earlier, when my dad bought his home in the 1950s the median price of 
a single-family house was around 2.2 times the median American family income.[cviii] 
Today, the Fed says, the median house sells for $374,900 while the median American 
income is $35,805 — a ratio of more than ten-to-one between housing costs and annual 
income.[cix] [cx]

As the Zillow study notes, “Across the country, the rent burden already exceeds the 
32 percent [of median income] threshold in 100 of the 386 markets included in this 
analysis….”[cxi]

And wherever housing prices become more than three times annual income, homelessness 
stalks like the grim reaper.

We’re told that America’s cities have seen this increase in housing costs since 
the 1950s in some part because of the growing wealth and population of this 
country.[cxii] There were, after all, 168 million people in the US the year my 
dad bought his house; today there are 330 million.[cxiii]

And it’s true that we haven’t been building enough new housing, particularly low 
income housing, as 40 years of Reaganism have driven down wages and income for 
working class people relative to all of their expenses.

But that’s not what’s been uniquely driving housing prices into the stratosphere — 
and, as a consequence, the crisis in homelessness — over the past decade. You can 
thank speculation for much of that.

As the Zillow-funded study noted: “This research demonstrates that the homeless 
population climbs faster when rent affordability — the share of income people 
spend on rent — crosses certain thresholds. In many areas beyond those thresholds, 
even modest rent increases can push thousands more Americans into homelessness.”

So how did we get here?

It started with a wave of foreign buyers over the past 30 years (particularly from 
China, Canada, Mexico, India and Colombia) who, just last year, picked up over 
154,000 homes as their way of parking money in America.[cxiv]

As Marketwatch noted in a 2015 article titled The Danger of Foreign Buyers Gobbling 
Up American Homes”: “Unusual high appreciation of the aforementioned urban centers 
is due to the ever-growing influx of foreign buyers — mostly wealthy Chinese — who 
view American residential real estate as the safest investment commodity. … According 
to a National Realtors Association survey, the Chinese spent $22 billion on U.S. 
housing in 12 months through March 2014…. [Other foreign buyers include primarily 
include] Canadians, British, Indians and Mexicans.”[cxv]

But foreign investment has been down for the past few years; what’s taken 
over and is really driving home prices today are massive, multi-billion-dollar 
funds that sweep into neighborhoods and buy everything available, bidding against 
families and driving up housing prices.

As noted in a Wall Street Journal article titled “Meet Your New Landlord: Wall 
Street,” in just one suburb (Spring Hill) of Nashville, “In all of Spring Hill, 
four firms … own nearly 700 houses … [which] amounts to about 5% of all the 
houses in town.”[cxvi]

This is the tiniest tip of the iceberg.

“On the first Tuesday of each month,” notes the Journal article about a similar 
phenomenon in Atlanta, investors “toted duffels stuffed with millions of dollars in 
cashier’s checks made out in various denominations so they wouldn’t have to interrupt 
their buying spree with trips to the bank…”[cxvii]

The same thing is happening in cities and suburbs all across America; the investment 
goliaths use fine-tuned computer algorithms to sniff out houses they can turn into 
rental properties, making over-market and unbeatable cash bids often within minutes 
of a house hitting the market.

After stripping neighborhoods of homes families can buy, they then begin raising 
rents as far as the market will bear.

In the Nashville suburb of Spring Hill, the vice-mayor, Bruce Hull, told the Journal 
you used to be able to rent “a three bedroom, two bath house for $1,000 a month.” 
Today, the Journal notes, “The average rent for 148 single-family homes in Spring 
Hill owned by the big four [Wall Street investor] landlords was about $1,773 a 
month…”[cxviii]

Ryan Dezember, in his book Underwater: How Our American Dream of Homeownership Became 
a Nightmare, describes the story of a family trying to buy a home in Phoenix. Every 
time they entered a bid, they were outbid instantly, the price rising over and over, 
until finally the family’s father threw in the towel.[cxix]

“Jacobs was bewildered,” writes Dezember. “Who was this aggressive bidder?”

Turns out it was Blackstone Group, now the world’s largest real estate investor. At 
the time they were buying $150 million worth of American houses every week, trying 
to spend over $10 billion. And that’s just a drop in the overall bucket.

In 2018, corporations bought 1 out of every 10 homes sold in America, according to 
Dezember, noting that, “Between 2006 and 2016, when the homeownership rate fell to 
its lowest level in fifty years, the number of renters grew by about a quarter.”

This all really took off around a decade ago, when Morgan Stanley published a 2011 
report titled “The Rentership Society,” arguing that snapping up houses and renting 
them back to people who otherwise would have wanted to buy them could be the newest 
and hottest investment opportunity for Wall Street’s billionaires and their funds.[cxx]

Turns out, Morgan Stanley was right. Warren Buffett, KKR and The Carlyle Group have 
all jumped into residential real estate, along with hundreds of smaller investment 
groups, and the National Home Rental Council has emerged as the industry’s premiere 
lobbying group, working to block rent control legislation and other efforts to 
control the industry.[cxxi]

As John Husing, the owner of Economics and Politics Inc., told The Tennessean 
newspaper, “What you have are neighborhoods that are essentially unregulated 
apartment houses. It could be disastrous for the city.”[cxxii]

Meanwhile, as unionization levels here remain among the lowest in the developed 
world, Reagan’s ongoing war on working people continues to wipe out America’s families.

At the same time that housing prices, both to purchase and to rent, are being driven 
through the roof by foreign and Wall Street investors, a new survey published this 
month by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard TH Chan School of 
Public Health found that American families are in crisis. Their study found:

“Thirty-eight percent (38%) of [all] households across the nation report facing 
serious financial problems in the past few months.

“There is a sharp income divide in serious financial problems, as 59% of those with 
annual incomes below $50,000 report facing serious financial problems in the past 
few months, compared with 18% of households with annual incomes of $50,000 or more.

“These serious financial problems are cited despite 67% of households reporting 
that in the past few months, they have received financial assistance from the government.

“Another significant problem for many U.S. households is losing their savings during 
the COVID-19 outbreak. Nineteen percent (19%) of U.S. households report losing all of 
their savings during the COVID-19 outbreak and not currently having any savings to 
fall back on.

“At the time the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) eviction ban 
expired, 27% of renters nationally reported serious problems paying their rent 
in the past few months.”[cxxiii]

These are not separate issues, and they are driving an explosion in homelessness. 
The Zillow study found:

“Communities where people spend more than 32 percent of their income on rent can 
expect a more rapid increase in homelessness.

“Income growth has not kept pace with rents, leading to an affordability crunch 
with cascading effects that, for people on the bottom economic rung, increases the 
risk of homelessness.

“The areas that are most vulnerable to rising rents, unaffordability and poverty 
hold 15 percent of the U.S. population — and 47 percent of people experiencing 
homelessness.”[cxxiv]

The Zillow study makes grim reading and is worth checking out. In community after 
community, when rent prices exceed 32 percent of median home income, homelessness 
explodes. It’s measurable, predictable, and is destroying what’s left of the 
American working class, particularly minorities.

The loss of affordable homes also locks otherwise middle class families out of 
the traditional way wealth is accumulated — through home ownership: over 61% of 
all American middle-income family wealth is their home’s equity.[cxxv] And as 
families are priced out of ownership and forced to rent, they become more vulnerable 
to homelessness.

Housing is one of the primary essentials of life. Nobody in America should be without 
it, and for society to work, housing costs must track incomes in a way that makes 
housing both available and affordable.

If ever there was a time to solve to this problem — and regulate corporate and 
foreign investment in American single-family housing — it’s now.
