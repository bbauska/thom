What it takes to build a middle class
FDR built America’s first truly large and robust middle class by passing the National 
Labor Relations Act (the “Wagner Act”)[xxxviii] that legalized and gave federal 
protection to unions and their members, while putting jobless Americans back to work 
with a variety of three- and four-letter federal agencies (referred to at the time as 
“the alphabet agencies”) that ultimately spent over $3 billion to lift over 20 million 
people out of unemployment and poverty.

They principally included a number of programs that Republicans mercilessly attacked 
as “socialism”:

— The Works Progress Administration (WPA)[xxxix] spent $11 million and put 8.5 million 
people to work building bridges, roads, public buildings, public parks, and airports. It 
was shut down in 1943, as by then most of the men it employed had been drafted for the 
anti-fascist (Antifa) war effort. During its existence the WPA built 650,000 miles of 
roads, 78,000 bridges, 125,000 buildings, and 700 miles of airport runways, reshaping 
the infrastructure of America and providing a launching pad for the economic vitality 
of the 1950-1980 era.

— The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)[xl] planted over 200 million trees (along with 
shrubs and grassland to fix soil), built national parks, and revived farmland that had 
been destroyed by poor agricultural practices, employing 2.5 million single young men 
and 8,500 young women before it ended in 1942. Its efforts, part of a larger FDR 
enterprise called the Great Plains Shelterbelt Project, helped reverse the effects of 
the Dust Bowl by planting windbreaks of trees from Texas to North Dakota. By 1941 most 
of America was again receiving normal levels of rainfall.

— The National Youth Administration (NYA)[xli] provided student work, employment, and 
skills training programs to over 4.5 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 25. 
In part because the program explicitly reached out to young women and African Americans, 
Republicans decried it as “communist” and made multiple efforts to shut it down; it 
ceased operations in 1943.

— The Farm Security Administration (FSA)[xlii] loaned over a billion dollars to farmers 
hard-hit by the Dust Bowl and set up camps across the west coast to house refugees from 
Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas whose farms had been wiped out. Its genesis was, in part, 
traceable to John Steinbeck’s’ novel The Grapes of Wrath about the plight of poor farmers 
and agricultural workers during that era.

— The Rural Electrification Administration (REA)[xliii], which still exists, took on the 
challenge of only 10 percent of Americans who didn’t live in cities having electricity. 
The program brought electricity to 98 percent of America’s farms and helped establish 
the nearly 900 rural electric co-ops that dot the nation today.

— The Federal Housing Administration (FHA)[xliv] is today the largest insurer of home 
mortgages in the world, having helped tens of millions of Americans buy homes (and 
nonprofits to build hospitals) since its creation in 1934.

— The Federal Emergency Works Administration (FERA)[xlv] only lasted from 1933 to 1935 
and was replaced by the WPA, but in its two years it provided employment to over 20 
million Americans and gave vaccinations and literacy classes to millions.

— The Civil Works Administration (CWA)[xlvi] lasted only one year (1933-1934), but in 
that year put over four million people to work building schools, roads, and sewers.

Other agencies didn’t directly employ large numbers of people but helped set the stage 
for the emergence of America’s first widespread middle class (and thus created the 
opportunities for them to attain “the American Dream”) by providing the necessary 
governmental infrastructure to stabilize business and prevent predation by the morbidly 
rich. They included:

— The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)[xlvii] regulated radio and eventually 
television and the internet.

— The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)[xlviii] guaranteed bank deposits so 
never again would Americans lose everything when rich bankers ran off with their money 
and shut down the bank (as happened to millions in the banking panic of 1932-1933).

— The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)[xlix] was created in 1934 to regulate 
Wall Street and investment houses. FDR put Joe Kennedy in charge of the agency, telling 
my late friend Gloria Swanson that he did so “because it takes a crook to catch a crook.”

— The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB),[l] created by the Wagner Act in 1935, 
protects the rights of unionized workers and oversees things like union elections.

— The Social Security Administration (SSA)[li] was created with the Social Security 
Act in 1935. Designed as “poverty insurance,” it gives every American of all ages a 
comprehensive insurance policy against personal disasters. People who’ve suffered 
disabilities from accident, illness, or birth defects qualify and Social Security 
will pay for housing and care as long as needed. The program also pays a retirement 
benefit to the elderly.

Building on the foundation of the “administrative state” that FDR created in the 1930s, 
presidents of both parties have since passed sweeping social safety net programs 
including Unemployment Insurance, the Minimum Wage (both established by FDR’s New 
Deal), Medicare and Medicaid (LBJ), expanded government protections of workers and 
the environment, and built massive government-funded infrastructure programs including 
the TVA (also FDR’s), the Eisenhower Highway System, and the Hoover Dam.

Most recently, President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act hearkened back to FDR and 
LBJ, using tax incentives and direct investment to stimulate American manufacturing and 
raise the wages of US workers. So far, it’s been an overwhelming success, keeping the 
economy humming while reducing inflation faster than in any other developed country in 
the world.
