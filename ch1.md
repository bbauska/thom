          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Although both presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald 
		    Reagan quoted Puritan leader John Winthrop’s 1630 “city on a hill” speech 
			(Reagan added the word “shining”) when referencing our land of opportunity, 
			the expression “American Dream” originates with historian James Truslow Adams 
			and his 1931 book The Epic of America.[xix] He describes “that dream of a land 
			in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with 
			opportunity for each according to ability or achievement.”</p>
          <p>He was expressing a sentiment held by most of the Founders of this country 
		    and the Framers of the Constitution, as well as foreign observers and leading 
			American philosophers throughout history. Alexis de Tocqueville in the 1830s 
			called it “the charm of anticipated success.” Henry David Thoreau, in Walden, 
			wrote in 1854: “If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, 
			and endeavors to live the life he has imagined, he will meet with a success 
			unexpected in common hours.”[xx]</p>
          <p>The phrase “American dream” was first used widely during the Progressive Era 
		    (1888-1920) and originally meant something quite different from today: it meant 
			justice, equality, and democracy during a time when the nation was run by 
			oligarchs, politicians were bought-off (so much so that states added ballot 
			initiatives to their constitutions to get around the problem), and workers 
			were routinely murdered for wanting to unionize.</p>
          <p>In this context, “the American dream” began to appear in newspaper articles and books; 
		    arguably President Grover Cleveland was referring to it when he gave his second State 
			of the Union speech in 1888 and said:</p>
          <blockquote>
			“We discover that the fortunes realized by our manufacturers are no longer solely the 
			reward of sturdy industry and enlightened foresight, but that they result from the 
			discriminating favor of the Government and are largely built upon undue exactions from 
			the masses of our people. The gulf between employers and the employed is constantly 
			widening, and classes are rapidly forming, one comprising the very rich and powerful, 
			while in another are found the toiling poor.
			“As we view the achievements of aggregated capital, we discover the existence of trusts, 
			combinations, and monopolies, while the citizen is struggling far in the rear or is 
			trampled to death beneath an iron heel. Corporations, which should be the carefully 
			restrained creatures of the law and the servants of the people, are fast becoming the 
			people's masters.”[xxi]
		  </blockquote>
		  <p>But the expression became cemented in the American vernacular in 1931 with JT Adams’ 
		    book, although at the time many were doubtful; it was the depth of the Republican Great 
			Depression. As FDR put America back together and created the nation’s first comprehensive 
			social safety net, the idea began to acquire its modern context of American government 
			providing the fertile soil for people to achieve their personal “dream.”</p>
          <p>Prior to the full enactment of Progressive Era and New Deal reforms, the American middle 
		    class was relatively small and mostly limited to professionals like physicians, attorneys, 
			and those in business management.</p>
          <p>We practiced largely unregulated capitalism until the 1930s, and the tiny class of 
		    morbidly rich people (that unregulated capitalism always produces) largely controlled 
			our political system through most of our nation’s history, particularly from the early 
			Industrial Revolution 1870s through the 1930s when President Franklin Roosevelt directly 
			challenged those who he called the “Economic Royalists.”[xxii]</p>
          <p>As recently as 1900, for example, poverty stalked America and farmers were at the mercy 
		    of the weather. There was no minimum wage; when workers tried to organize unions police 
			would help employers beat or even murder their ringleaders; and social safety net 
			programs like unemployment insurance, Social Security, Medicare, food and housing 
			supports, and Medicaid didn’t exist.</p>
          <p>There was no income tax to pay for such programs, and federal receipts were a mere 3 
		    percent of GDP (today they’re around 20 percent[xxiii]).  As the President’s Council of 
			Economic Advisors noted in their 2000 Annual Report:</p>
          <blockquote>
			“To appreciate how far we have come, it is instructive to look back on what American life 
			was like in 1900. At the turn of the century, fewer than 10 percent of homes had 
			electricity, and fewer than 2 percent of people had telephones. An automobile was a 
			luxury that only the very wealthy could afford.
			“Many women still sewed their own clothes and gave birth at home. Because chlorination 
			had not yet been introduced and water filtration was rare, typhoid fever, spread by 
			contaminated water, was a common affliction. One in 10 children died in infancy. 
			Average life expectancy was a mere 47 years.
			“Fewer than 14 percent of Americans graduated from high school. ... Widowhood was far 
			more common than divorce [because of the dire economic consequences to women of 
			divorce]. The average household had close to five members, and a fifth of all households 
			had seven or more. …
			“Average income per capita, in 1999 dollars, was about $4,200. … The typical workweek in 
			manufacturing was about 50 hours, 20 percent longer than the average today.”[xxiv]
			</blockquote>
		  <p>The Progressive Era laid the groundwork for President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, 
		    which he rolled out after his inauguration in March 1933. The major pre-FDR Progressive 
			Era accomplishments included:</p>
          <p>— The 16th Amendment (1913) established the ability of Congress to create and levy a tax 
		    on personal income and corporate profits. Prior to that, most government functions were 
			funded by tariffs on foreign goods, which paid for almost all federal functions from the 
			George Washington to the Abraham Lincoln administrations, about two-thirds of government 
			from Lincoln to Wilson, and about a third of government until the mid-20th century as 
			“free trade” collapsed tariffs while leading to an explosion of foreign-made goods in 
			American stores.[xxv] Lacking the revenue from an income tax served as a limit on the 
			size and functions of the federal government; the passage of the 16th Amendment set the 
			stage for the New Deal and subsequent expansion of federal programs to this day.</p>
          <p>- The 17th Amendment (1913) ended the practice of state governments appointing US 
		    senators and turned that choice over to each state’s voters. Prior to that, wealthy 
			people and big businesses would make sure their choice of senators were put into office 
			by essentially bribing state legislators and governors. The event that most conspicuously 
			led to the 17th Amendment was when William Clark, a Montana copper baron and one of 
			America’s richest men, reportedly stood outside the doors of the Montana legislature in 
			1898 as they voted on that state’s next US senator. Clark, the story goes, had a 
			pocketful of white envelopes in his jacket pocket, each containing a crisp new $1000 
			bill, which he passed out to each legislator who’d voted for him as they left the 
			chamber. The national outrage was so severe that the Senate first refused to seat Clark, 
			then forced his resignation in 1899 with a motion to void his position. Montana’s 
			legislators, not forgetting his great wealth and many favors, returned him to the US 
			Senate in 1900, where he served from 1901 until 1907.[xxvi]</p>
		  <p>— The 19th Amendment (1920) nationally enfranchised women. This amendment to give women 
		    the right to vote across the country was written by Susan B. Anthony, and passed both 
			the House and Senate in 1878, with Wisconsin and Illinois being the first states to 
			ratify it. It failed to reach the threshold of three-quarters of the states, however, 
			until 1919 and was certified and put into law on August 26, 1920. The first state to 
			enfranchise women was Wyoming, which, in 1869, passed a law allowing women to vote, 
			own and inherit property, have legal custody of their own children, and hold public 
			office.[xxvii] That was, not coincidentally, the year that Susan B. Anthony and 
			Elizabeth Cady Stanton established the National Woman’s Suffrage Association.[xxviii]</p>
		  <p>— The Sherman Anti-Trust Act (1890)[xxix] and the Clayton Antitrust Act (1914)[xxx], 
		    both designed to stop and unwind the excesses of the morbidly rich and the giant 
			corporations they controlled.</p>
		  <p>— Both federal and state-by-state legislation regulating working hours and conditions, 
		    improving sanitary living conditions and open spaces in big cities, and protecting 
			consumers from fraud and hustlers.</p>
		  <p>The Progressive Era came to an end with the election of conservative Republican Warren 
		    Harding in 1920. Harding campaigned on two major slogans: “A return to normalcy”[xxxi] 
			and “Less government in business and more business in government.”[xxxii]  The 
			“normalcy” slogan was a promise to drop President Woodrow Wilson’s 91 percent top 
			income tax bracket down to 25 percent, and the second slogan essentially meant 
			“privatize and deregulate.” </p>
          <p>Harding did all three, causing (through his, Coolidge’s, and Hoover’s Republican 
		    administrations between 1921-1932) an explosion in the stock market creating 
			“Roaring 20’s” piles of cash for the very, very rich while crushing unions and 
			driving down working-class wages. </p>
          <p>Harding’s conservative era ended abruptly when his deregulation of the banking and 
 		    securities industries led straight to the stock market crash of 1929 and what was 
		    then called the Republican Great Depression.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">This has happened before</h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">What if, lacking an organized resistance to fascism 
		    like we have had in previous eras (the civil rights movement, SDS, BLM, the 
			Wobbly’s) the Democratic Party itself could play the role of producing radical, 
			positive transformation across America? Sound crazy? It’s actually happened 
			twice.</p>
          <p>The first time was in the 1930s, when Franklin Roosevelt’ New Deal literally 
		    flipped our politics and the American economy upside down, turning us from a 
			raw, harsh capitalist system to a democratic socialist system with Social 
			Security, legalized unions, unemployment insurance, a minimum wage, workplace 
			safety rules, massive infrastructure construction, and millions of Americans 
			being employed directly by the government to end poverty.</p>
          <p>It happened again in the 1960s, with Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society, producing 
		    Medicare, Medicaid, the civil rights act, the voting rights act, food stamps, 
			low income housing, National Public Radio, a transformation of our educational 
			system for the better, USAID, Job Corps, VISTA, Head Start, a major Social 
			Security expansion, The National Endowment for the Arts, and what was essentially 
			free college.</p>
          <p>Sunday, I was on Ali Velshi’s show on MSNBC in a conversation about protest 
		    movements. I pointed out that back in the 60s, when I was in SDS, there were a 
			number of groups that were quite active, particularly on college campuses, but 
			today most of them have been gutted or banned.</p>
          <p>Black Lives Matter has disintegrated, the movement against Israel’s slaughter 
		    in Gaza has led to universities rolling over and capitulating, and the #MeToo 
			and abortion rights movements are essentially leaderless. Which leaves the 
			Democratic Party, as I mentioned on Ali’s show. Billionaires and racists turned 
			the Republican Party into a neofascist protest party over the past decade; 
			progressives and those of us who want to preserve democracy in America need 
			to similarly seize control of and radicalize the Democratic Party in the tradition 
			of FDR and LBJ.</p>
          <p>There is a vital lesson progressives must learn, which is how the far right took 
		    control of the Republican Party over a decade ago and forced the entire Conservative 
		    establishment to lurch so far to the Right that they’ve even dumped people like Liz 
		    Cheney and George W. Bush.</p>
          <p>If progressives hope to have any shot at influencing today’s Democratic Party and 
		    kicking out the corporate sellout Democrats and replacing them with real-deal 
		    progressives, then we need to get to work right now to do exactly what the Tea 
		    Party did a decade and a half ago to take power. And it starts in our own backyards.</p>
          <p>Let me introduce you to the now-defunct Concord Project, a right-wing organization 
		    that, a decade ago, was in charge of helping the Tea Party’s successful effort to 
			take over and radicalize the GOP.</p>
          <p>The Concord Project expanded their get-out-the-vote strategy beyond just traditional 
		    phone banking, canvassing, and putting up “vote Republican” signs. Instead, they 
			decided to infiltrate local politics by encouraging Tea Partiers and conservatives 
			more generally to become “Precinct Committee Members.” Here’s their pitch in their 
			own words from one of their Obama-era YouTube training videos:</p>
          <p>“What’s the most powerful political office in the world? It is not the President of 
		    the United States. It’s Precinct Committeeman.” So why is a Precinct Committeeman (or 
			person) so important?</p>
          <p>“First, because precinct committeemen and only precinct committeemen get to elect the 
		    leaders of the political parties; if you want to elect the leadership of one of the 
			two major political parties in this country, then you have to become a precinct 
			committeeman.”</p>
          <p>As in the oldest and most basic governing reality in a republic: true and effective 
		    political power flows up from the bottom. It starts with Precinct Committeemen and women 
		    — people who are either appointed or win local elections with very few votes at stake, 
		    in some cases only 10 or 20 votes — to gain positions that pretty much anyone can hold 
		    but which wield enormous power.</p>
          <p>It’s Precinct Committee Persons who elect district, county, and state party officials 
		    and delegates, who choose primary nominees that then go on to hold elected office, 
			and who help draft a party’s platform. They’re also generally the first people who 
			elected officials meet with when they come back into the district. And those officials 
			listen carefully to what Precinct Committee persons have to say.</p>
          <p>So, the Concord folks told their people, if far right Tea Partiers moved in and took 
		    over Precinct Committee seats then they’d also be able to nominate a slew of Tea 
			Partiers to hold higher offices within the Republican Party and for primaries.
            And those Tea Party Republican Party primary candidates would then be winnowed down 
			in the primary to one Tea Party Republican to run against the Democrat in the general 
			election. This way, Tea Partiers would end up dominating the GOP.</p>
          <p>That was their pitch: take over the party from the inside, from the bottom up. And it 
		    worked. Control the primaries — as the Precinct Committee Members do — and you control 
			the ultimate candidate, the election, and ultimately the nation, as we’ve seen repeatedly 
            since the Tea Party era. This is from a video they posted in January of 2010, with the same 
			Concord Project Representative encouraging people in the Tea Party to do exactly what I 
			just described:</p>
          <p>“This video is for all the people out there in the Tea Party movement, the 9/12ers, 
		    just good decent people who are really fearful of what’s going on in the country and 
			want to do something to fix things and they’re not sure what to do. Well, I’ve got a 
			solution for you. The best way to ensure that conservatives win that all-important 
			primary election is to become a real ball player in the ball game of politics. And 
			that ball game is called party politics.</p>
          <p>“And this is a secret, they don’t want the party establishments, any incumbents don’t 
		    want you to know about this and that’s why I’m telling you about it. Only precinct 
			committeemen get to vote for, to elect party leaders. Only precinct committeemen can 
			vote to endorse candidates.” Again, that was in 2010, 11 months before that year’s 
			elections.</p>
          <p>In 2008, half of the Republican Party’s Precinct Committeemen positions around the 
		    country were vacant. But by 2011, motivated by the efforts of people like the Concord 
			Project, the Tea Party (which has now mostly morphed into MAGA) had swept in to fill 
			the gaps: They’d filled up the Republican Party.</p>
          <p>And we saw the results of the Precinct Committee takeover first in 2012 and more and 
		    more vividly in every election since: the GOP is now being driven largely from the 
			bottom up by activists who’ve taken over the party and are also running for school 
			boards and other local offices.</p>
          <p>In 2012, after this campaign to get movement conservatives into the GOP, Tea Party 
		    candidates got onto nearly every ballot around the country and picked up 87 new 
			seats in the US House of Representatives and 9 new seats in the Senate.</p>
          <p>And even though the Tea Party didn’t then control a majority within the GOP in 
		    Congress like MAGA does now, they did control the Republican Party’s platform 
			because they had control of the Precinct Committees.</p>
          <p>Progressives and believers in democracy who want to fight Trump’s fascism need to do 
		    the same thing, only within the Democratic Party. The rules about how to become a 
			Precinct Committee Person vary from state to state, so step one is to show up at your 
			local Democratic Party, sign up, and find out who the players are and what the rules are.</p>
          <p>Even the names of these positions vary, as former Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David 
		    Pepper notes on his excellent Substack newsletter Pepperspectives: “In Cincinnati, we 
			call them ‘precinct executives.’ Elsewhere, they are called ‘committeemen’ or 
			‘committeewomen.’ In other places, ‘ward chairs.’ Whatever they’re called, they are 
			the basic unit of each city or county party structure in the country.”</p>
          <p>If we’ve learned one thing over the last few years, it’s that the Democratic Party 
		    shifted to the corporate “center” with Clinton and Obama and its establishment has 
			been highly resistant to adopting real progressive change or elevating genuine 
			progressives (like AOC) to senior/leadership positions.</p>
          <p>And as we see right now in the Party’s leadership’s apparent inability to call out 
		    Trump and his parade of horribles, this unwillingness to stand up and fight is 
			leading to the dismantling of programs that progressives fought so hard for over 
			the entire last century.</p>
          <p>We have been too often losing these fights, and to win them takes more than union 
		    protests in Wisconsin, a march on Trump’s birthday, or even voting, although those 
			are all important.</p>
          <p>But to really take power, like the Tea Party did in one short year, it will take an 
		    infiltration of the Democratic Party itself through claiming Precinct Committee 
			positions, as well as simply showing up regularly at the meetings.</p>
          <p>If this year, starting now, we execute the same strategy the Tea Party did in 2009 
		    when the billionaires funding it first set out to take over the GOP, then we can 
			move the Democratic Party back to its progressive roots and finally see the progressive 
			reforms — and election victories — that we’ve been fighting for. We have 16 months 
			before the 2026 midterm elections and your mission is to show up at your local 
			Democratic Party headquarters and begin the infiltration.</p>
          <p>Good luck and get started!.</p>
