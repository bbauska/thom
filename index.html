          “gilded age?” What comes next? Like Gatsby’s 1925 West</h2>
                       
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Thom Hartmann web blog information regarding politics 
            in 2025. From Portland, Oregon &amp; Goldbar, Washington.</p>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <p>Egg mansion — stuffed with opulence but rotting underneath — Trump’s America 
            is plunging headlong into a new Gilded Age, this time gilded not with gold but 
            with grift. The signs are everywhere. There’s the multimillion-dollar White 
            House ballroom Trump wants built for his private fundraising galas, while 
            federal workers go without raises. There’s the Qatari luxury jet/bribe gifted 
            to him — worth hundreds of millions — that Senate Republicans just voted to 
            let him keep after leaving office, even after the Pentagon diverted nearly a 
            billion dollars from a nuclear weapons maintenance program to refurbish it.</p>
          <p>And while billionaires hoard wealth and party with their wannabe king, a 
            chilling jobs report has reminded the rest of us just how fragile the working 
            class has become in this deregulated, union-busting, trickle-down circus. 
            (Trump just fired the woman in charge of the agency that compiled the 
            statistics because he doesn’t like the numbers; nobody in the world will 
            trust future employment numbers out of this administration.) Like in 
            Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, this isn’t sustainable.</p>
          <p>The first Gilded Age — also birthed by Republican policies — collapsed into 
            the Republican Great Depression. If history is any guide, this one will, too. 
            Trump has built a country of spectacle and showmanship, where glitter masks 
            decay and inequality reigns supreme. But even the most gold-plated illusions 
            eventually crack. The question is: will we stop it before the crash, or let 
            this corrupt spectacle drag us into a second Republican Great Depression like 
            The Fourth Turning predicts?</p>

            buzzsaw at town hall</h2>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Republicans showing up in public to defend their and 
            Trump’s obscene behavior is becoming like trying to defy gravity; it rarely 
            works out well. Mike Johnson knows this, which is why he won’t do town halls 
            and he’s advised all the other Republicans to likewise avoid contact with the 
            dirty public (but keep up the big-bucks dinners with lobbyists and donors).</p>
          <p>Wisconsin Republican Congressman Brian Stiel thought he could pull it off, and 
            was quickly set straight. While about 50 presumably Democratic protesters showed 
            up outside the venue, inside the presumably Republican constituents of Stiel’s 
            were having none of his BS. He tried to defend ICE wearing masks and was booed 
            down. Same thing happened when he said it was important for Republicans to have 
            cut Medicaid with the Big Ugly Bill. One voter called him an “embarrassment,” 
            another said, “You’re not the right fit for us anymore,” and a third said: “I 
            am so disappointed in how you represent us as the citizen of Walworth County. 
            Southeast Wisconsin has not been represented by you. President Trump seems to 
            run southeast Wisconsin through you.” While Stiel thought he could defy 
            political gravity, it didn’t work; this is another example showing there’s a 
            good chance for Republicans to get wiped out in the ’26 elections, which, of 
            course, is why they’re so vigorously trying to gerrymander Red states and purge 
            millions of voters from the rolls in Blue cities. Will it work? Will Gavin 
            Newsom call a special election to redraw California’s maps? Will other 
            Democratic states follow Illinois Governor JB Pritzker’s advice to “fight 
            gerrymandering fire with fire” and Congressman and Progressive Caucus 
            President Emeritus Mark Pocan’s advice for Blue states to begin their own 
            voter purges? Stay tuned…</p>

            Cuts in Medicaid</h2>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">First it was Nazi salutes; now Elon wants you to know 
            that “women are built to be traded.” Seriously. Check this out; it sorta speaks 
            for itself and tells you everything you never wanted to know about this bizarre 
            billionaire African immigrant who is now the GOP’s single largest donor:</p>
          <p>Trump wants the federal government to be able to track every one of your 
            medical and health issues in real time, and Big Tech is all excited about 
            being able to get their hands on your private data. Georgetown University 
            law professor who specializes in public health, Lawrence Gostin, noted, “There 
            are enormous ethical and legal concerns. Patients across America should be very 
            worried that their medical records are going to be used in ways that harm them 
            and their families.” The Associated Press reports: “More than 60 companies, 
            including major tech companies like Google, Amazon and Apple as well as health 
            care giants like UnitedHealth Group and CVS Health, have agreed to share patient 
            data in the system.” Just what we all needed, right? These guys snooping into 
            our private medical information and then sharing it all with Trump, Noem, 
            Bondi, and ICE…</p>
          <p>Trump is threatening other countries with steep tariffs if they don’t change 
            their sovereign foreign policy decisions. The Constitution says only Congress 
            can impose tariffs; it’s unambiguous. The Emergency Powers Act that Trump is 
            citing as justification for his imposing unilateral tariffs doesn’t even 
            mention the word “tariffs.” What he’s doing is entirely illegal and no 
            business is going to build a factory here just because Trump threw up a 
            tariff when they know he could (and probably will) change his mind next 
            month or the next president — or a future Congress or the Supreme Court 
            — can cancel his tariffs. That’s why Trump’s tariffs are not only screwing 
            up America’s standing in the world but also taking a hammer to our economy. 
            But now he’s using them as punishments; in this case, going after Canada’s 
            Prime Minister Mark Carney for saying that he’d support a Palestinian state.</p>
          <p>Felon Trump and accused felon Netanyahu want nothing to do with that, so 
            Trump’s saying he’s going to hit Canada — or, more correctly, he’s going to 
            hit American consumers of Canadian goods — with a 35% tariff. This is nuts 
            and, as I mentioned yesterday, he’s only doing it because it forces leaders 
            of countries around the world to come grovel before him the way he’d always 
            hoped the guys on Wall Street and in New York high society would do (but they 
            refused). Trump’s fragile ego has become a wrecking ball that threatens a 
            second Republican Great Depression. Buckle up…</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title"><br>4,725 Epsten Wire<br><br>Transfers?</h2>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Where are the 4,725 Epstein wire transfers that Trump, 
            Noem, and Bondi are hiding? That’s the question my senator, Ron Wyden, wants 
            answers to. He’s unearthed proof that the details of the cash movements 
            totaling over a billion dollars are in the possession of the Trump 
            administration, but they’re not only refusing to release them, they won’t even 
            acknowledge Wyden’s demand for transparency. It could, after all, blow open the 
            entire underage sex-trafficking business Epstein was running out of his two 
            homes, each just down the street from his “best friend” Trump’s homes in New 
            York City and Palm Beach.</p>
          <p>We also learned yesterday that the DOJ has been going through the Epstein 
            documents and redacting anything that has to do with Trump. Meanwhile, in 
            what’s almost certainly the down payment in the deal Trump’s criminal defense 
            lawyer Todd Blanche worked out with her, Ghislaine Maxwell was moved yesterday 
            from a real women’s prison in Florida to a “minimum security facility” in 
            Texas that’s more like a women’s sorority house. This is particularly odd 
            since it’s against the law as Allison Gill notes: you can’t put sex offenders 
            into minimum security facilities (because they could represent a threat to 
            the other inmates; the same reason there are no violent offenders there). 
            Somebody waived that rule — or Blanche/Noem/Bondi/Trump are ignoring it 
            — and the media’s not even asking who or why.</p>
          <p>The big question now is whether Trump’s base will accept it (Fox already has) 
            when the coverup is complete, Maxwell testifies that he had nothing to do with 
            underage girls but Bill Clinton was sure there, and Trump declares “total 
            transparency.” I’m betting, reluctantly, that they will and it’ll all blow 
            over by November, but with this case it’s impossible to know for sure.</p>

        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There was a mass die off of Monarch butterflies is 
            2024 and we now know why. Over 90 percent of Monarch butterflies that were 
            common across North America just 50 years ago are gone, and there was another 
            mass die-off at a California over-wintering site last December. Up until 
            now, nobody has known for sure what’s killing the insects; the main suspects 
            have been pesticides, climate change, and loss of habitat to development.</p>
          <p>So a plucky group of scientists visited the mass death site and autopsied a 
            bunch of the Monarchs; most had as many as 7 different pesticides in their 
            bodies, all at lethal levels. We have to stop using these deadly chemicals (that 
            aren’t good for us, either!) and return to sustainable agriculture practices. 
            Roundup, for example, is known to cause cancer in humans and dogs, but the last 
            Trump administration said they could ditch the warning labels. You can kill 
            weeds with high-strength vinegar, and Neem oil is a great insecticide; there 
            are lots of natural alternatives to the chemicals that are applied both 
            commercially and in residential environments and we should all use them, 
            encourage our HOAs and neighbors to use them, and push our politicians to 
            get the EPA back on the job.</p>

            today’s firestorm around the Epstein documents arguably started when he 
            tweeted that Trump was in the files. Which has led to some significant changes 
            in the Trump/media/politics/deep-state landscape that it’s important to review. 
            They include questions about the future of Trump, his cult followers, a

          <p>To begin: if you want everything around the Epstein furor to make sense, all

            fairly large and preexisted his appearance on the scene. And that’s part of 
            his problem.</p>
          <p>It’s large enough to have in it three kinds of people.</p>
          <p>The first kind of person is the “true believer.” They make up most of the 
            Trump cult members, what we call MAGA. They’re usually pretty much willing to 
            overlook anything Dear Leader does, much like the devoted followers of Rajaneesh 
            and Jim Jones.</p>
          <p>And then there are the “facilitators.” These are cynical people who don’t 
            believe the cult leader’s BS, but go along with it — and even promote it — 
            because it works to their benefit. They are typically parasitic. They usually 
            make their money from the members of the cult, or get power from them (votes 
            in this case), and often use their position in the cult to gain other benefits 
            like sexual favors or fame.</p>
          <p>In this case the facilitators are the Republican politicians who are begging 
            money from their followers and voters, and then vote to screw those followers 
            on behalf of the cult leader — Trump — and his billionaire friends. The morbidly 
            rich keep the cult facilitators in line by funding their elections and, in the 
            case of Republican Supreme Court justices, their lavish lifestyles.</p>
          <p>When you understand that it’s a cult and that some of the people who seem 
            high-up in it are true believers and not facilitators, suddenly Marjorie 
            Taylor Greene’s behavior makes sense when she seems to attack Trump: she’s a 
            true believer. She’s completely bought into the conspiracy nuttery that 
            brought him to office twice.</p>
          <p>You also begin to understand why Chuck Grassley ran that Senate judiciary 
            committee the way he did to push through Emil Bove over the objections of the 
            Democrats and literally hundreds of former lawyers, judges, and Department of 
            Justice officials: Grassley is a cynical facilitator.</p>
          <p>And you understand why the Republican Congressman from Kentucky, Thomas 
            Massey, has joined with Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna to demand release of 
            the Epstein documents and essentially turned on Trump.</p>
          <p>Massey represents the third kind of person in a cult, who only shows up 
            typically toward the early stages of the collapse of the cult, and then 
            presents a real danger to the cult leader.</p>

            False Reality</h2>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">This third category are “the true believers who have 
            suddenly seen a crack in reality,” the false reality that the cult leader has 
            created around them. You could call them “former true believers.” Once they 
            saw the light through that crack — saw the real world — they realized that 
            they were being lied to.</p>
          <p>When a cult is on the verge of collapse, these kinds of people become more 
            and more numerous as more and more people begin to wake up from the cult 
            leader’s trance.</p>
          <p>At that point, they turn on the cult leader the way a spurned lover turns on 
            the previous object of their affection. They become angry and vengeful. They 
            demand answers. They want to know how they got sucked in and why: “Who did 
            this to me? And to whose benefit?”</p>
          <p>This is how Donald Trump’s world is disintegrating right now, and the danger 
            is that, like Jim Jones, Charles Manson, and Rajaneesh, he may destroy a lot 
            of lives when he goes down.</p>
          <p>He may not kill them like Jim Jones did — although he already arguably killed 
            a half-million of his cult followers with the malicious, incompetent way he 
            handled Covid — but he will destroy many of the people and institutions around 
            him. This is what narcissists do when they begin to psychologically collapse.</p>
          <p>As I noted two weeks ago, my late friend Armin Lehmann was there when he gave 
            Hitler the information that the war was lost. He stood outside Hitler’s door 
            when he shot himself. He wrote a book about it, and told me that Hitler wanted 
            Germany destroyed by the Allies because the German people, he believed, had 
            “let him down.”</p>
          <p>This is “narcissistic collapse,” which I’ve written about several times over 
            the past dozen or so years. Donald Trump is almost certainly going to hit this 
            state of mind (he’s already close), and many of his “true believer” followers 
            are in the midst of their own personal narcissistic collapses right now.</p>
          <p>And that is what makes this a very dangerous moment for America.</p>
          <p>Suing Rupert Murdoch, for example, was an extraordinarily reckless and 
            dangerous thing for Trump to do. Newscorp isn’t going to roll over and pay 
            Trump a bribe, in all probability, because he needs them more than they need 
            him.</p>
          <p>Murdoch, after all, is the guy who created the cult that Trump has come to 
            dominate: they’re called “Fox News viewers.” He created it long before Donald 
            Trump came along: he and Roger Ailes simply let Donald Trump into it back in 
            2015 because he was good for ratings and thus increased profits.</p>
          <p>So, once Murdoch decided that Donald Trump could benefit his cult and make 
            money for his television network (and even lower his taxes), he let Donald 
            believe that he was the leader of the cult. And for many people in that Fox 
            “News” Viewer cult, Trump actually did become the leader.</p>
          <p>But the real guy who controls the cult is Rupert Murdoch. It’s not Donald 
            Trump. Trump is just today’s figurehead. Sort of like with the Catholic 
            Church, Trump is the pope right now. But when the pope goes, he gets 
            replaced.</p>
          <p>The institution lives on, and you can bet your bottom dollar that the Murdoch 
            family is not going to let the cult that they’ve built with Fox “News,” the 
            cult that has made them billions of dollars and given them the power to 
            influence governments on three continents, dissolve.</p>
          <p>They’ll jettison Donald Trump long before they’ll let go of that kind of 
            power.</p>
          <p>The way Rupert Murdoch’s father Sir Keith Murdoch first created this cult 
            back in the 1940s was by feeding the readers of his newspapers in Australia 
            a steady diet of racist outrage, fear, and anger. As historian John C. McManus 
            writes in his definitive book Fire and Fortitude: The US Army in the Pacific 
            War, 1941-1943:</p>
          <p>“As American soldiers began arriving in numbers during the early months of 
            1942, they were greeted with tremendous enthusiasm by the Australians, many 
            of whom couldn’t hide their immense relief at the soothing presence of the 
            GIs. … Appreciative crowds gathered at piers and station platforms to greet 
            incoming ships and troop trains. Waving and cheering, they studied the 
            newcomers with great curiosity.”</p>
          <p>But Sir Keith Murdoch thought he could make a pile of money by turning 
            Australians against Americans. Inflaming nationalist and xenophobic sentiments 
            would sell papers, goose advertising, and make him rich.</p>

        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Thus, as McManus documents:</p>
          <p>“A chain of newspapers owned by Sir Keith Murdoch, father of latter-year 
            media magnate Rupert Murdoch, earned a reputation among the yanks as relentlessly 
            anti-American. Truth, a particularly brassy Melbourne tabloid, often published 
            lurid tales of GI rapes of innocent Australian girls and seduction of married women.</p>
          <p>“On occasion, Australian soldiers vented their frustration over such tales 
            with violence. Small groups of Diggers roamed around some of the cities, 
            beating up any American soldiers whom they saw dating local girls. … An 
            American soldier was even shot and killed one morning as he emerged from the 
            house of a married woman.”</p>
          <p>Eventually, the hate against Americans that Murdoch had stirred up blossomed 
		    into full-fledged riots in multiple Australian cities, creating a real problem 
			for the war effort but boosting Murdoch’s newspaper sales (and, presumably, 
			profits) into the stratosphere as his papers developed their own cult following 
			in Oz.</p>
          <p>Keith then passed the cult and the media outlets that had created it along to 
		    Rupert, who then took his brand of cult-forming “journalism” (Fox called it 
			“entertainment” when they were sued by Dominion Voting Systems) to England and 
			then, ironically, to America.</p>
		  <p>By definition, people who live in a cult live in an unreality. A fictitious 
		    world. That’s the key to how the cult and its leaders control them: they 
			convince the cult members that they’re the only ones who truly understand how 
			the world works, that they have “secret knowledge,” and that everyone outside 
			the cult is either blind, evil, or both.</p>
          <p>This creates an us-versus-them narrative so powerful it replaces facts, 
		    isolates them from reality, and makes loyalty to the cult and its perceived 
			leader more important than truth itself.</p>

          <p>People who watch Fox “News,” for example, believe that what they hear on NPR 
		    is “liberal propaganda,” which is why they support defunding public broadcasting. 
			What they actually hear on public broadcasting, however, is just the news. It 
			reflects reality. Actual reality. But they think it’s liberal propaganda because 
			their cult told them so.</p>

		  <p>In much the same way Jim Jones’ followers and Charles Manson’s followers 
		    didn’t listen to their friends when they tried to share reality with them or 
			point out how they had been indoctrinated, brainwashed, and lied to, the 
			people in the Fox “News” cult don’t want to listen to reality. They want the 
			comfortable lies and the excuses for hate and outrage that they have wrapped 
			themselves in for years.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title"><br>Murdoch<br><br>Now Who?</h2>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Murdoch now has to make a tough decision. He’s already 
		    gotten most of what he needed from Trump — a massive tax break for himself and 
			his family, and deregulation of the broadcast and internet space — so he only 
			needs Trump now because Donald makes for good television.</p>

          <p>But “good television” can work two ways for a public official, for or against 
		    them. If Trump has sufficiently pissed off Murdoch, or he thinks that Trump’s 
			beginning to harm the GOP and thus the cult that the Murdoch family and their 
			well-paid talent largely control, he could give Trump the old heave-ho.</p>

          <p>So, if Trump gets thrown out of the Fox “News” Viewer cult — essentially gets 
		    fired as the cult leader — the cult will continue. It would simply lose a very 
			small percentage of its hard-core true believers who’d completely surrendered 
			their personalities to Trump, and even those folks are probably retrievable.</p>

          <p>The problem for Murdoch and other facilitators of the Fox “News” Viewer cult 
		    that Trump now leads is who will fill the vacuum that’ll be created when Trump 
			is gone, whether it’s from natural causes or an impeachment or 25th Amendment 
			action that Murdoch and Fox could provoke. Who will continue to defend the 
			interests of the morbidly rich and the monopolistic parts of corporate America 
			and become the next leader of the GOP?</p>

          <p>JD Vance is unlikely to be able to fill Trump’s shoes, which has to be giving 
		    Murdoch heartburn. Vance has virtually no hold at all on the Fox “News” Viewer 
			cult that Trump today dominates.</p>

          <p>He is not beloved by the cult; if anything they think of him as weak and 
		    effeminate. He uses eyeliner. He married a brown-skinned woman and has brown-
			skin children. His wife refuses to adopt Christianity.</p>

          <p>“He must be weak,” is the consensus across much of the white racist base that 
		    constitutes the MAGA-sphere.</p>

          <p>Nonetheless, Vance himself apparently thinks he can take over for Donald. 
		    He’s deluding himself, of course, but he appears to believe it. Just look at 
			how he just publicly demanded that Donald Trump’s “artwork” be released by the 
			Wall Street Journal or the FBI.</p>

          <p>He knows a release of more damaging evidence of Trump’s long-term relationship 
		    with Epstein — and thus, in the minds of the cult followers, participation in 
			the deep state conspiracy that exploits children while it runs the world — could 
			inflict incredible damage on Trump, and even make Vance president.</p>

          <p>What man who believes destiny and God want him to become president wouldn’t 
		    jump at something like that? Remember, JD Vance said the following about Donald 
			Trump:</p>

          <p>“I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon… 
		    or that he’s America’s Hitler.”</p>

          <p>“[Trump is] a disaster and a bad man. A morally reprehensible human being.”</p>

          <p>“Fellow Christians, everyone is watching us when we apologize for this man.”</p>

          <p>Vance understood the cult even before he cynically pretended he was part of 
		    it when he saw Trump was prevailing: like most other Republican politicians 
			and the billionaires who fund them, he’s an exploiter, a cult “facilitator.”</p>

          <p>It’s extremely unlikely, however, that he’ll ever become the leader of the 
		    Fox Viewer cult; it’s unlikely, in fact, that the subset of the Fox cult that 
			has formed around Trump will survive as Trump followers.</p>

          <p>As John Hobbes famously said, “Men heap together the mistakes of their lives 
		    and create a monster they call destiny.” With the Epstein revelations turning 
			into a torrent, that’s now the story of Donald John Trump.</p>

          <p>When Trump is gone — and that day will eventually come — his corner of the 
		    Fox “News” Viewer cult will most likely shatter back into dozens of smaller 
			organizations, many of which will simply be returning to their roots: Proud 
			Boys, Three Percenters, anti-abortion freaks, rightwing preachers hustling 
			their congregations, etc.</p>

        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">After all, as Maureen Dowd points out, Trump has now 
		    become the deep state he once decried. He’s creating the very “FEMA Camps” 
			that had Republicans and Fox “News” Viewer cult members hysterical when 
			Obama was president.</p>

          <p>He’s developing a masked, anonymous, unaccountable nationwide secret police 
		    force and is compiling massive amounts of intelligence on everyday Americans. 
			Between his spy agencies and data brokers, he has access to anybody’s social 
			media posts, emails, and medical and travel records. He’s given ICE full and 
			unfettered access to everybody’s Medicaid and other government records.</p>

          <p>If rightwingers keep protesting him or demanding more information about 
		    Jeffrey Epstein, they will be next in his crosshairs and that could begin 
			the final stage of his participation in the Fox “News” Viewer cult. He’s 
			already called them stupid, hysterical, and told them they’re dupes for the 
			Democrats, claiming he no longer wants their support.</p>

          <p>Thus, we stand very close to what may be a true crossroads moment for America.</p>

          <p>If Trump survives this politically, he’ll most likely begin a serious crackdown 
		    modeled after the June, 1934 Night of the Long Knives (albeit probably less 
			bloody), purging his opposition within his own ranks much like Putin did a 
			decade ago in Russia and Orbán is doing now in Hungary. It’ll further damage 
			American democracy and make it much harder for us to recover our previous New 
			Deal and Great Society political and economic systems.</p>

          <p>On the other hand, if Trump goes down in flames and Vance, Johnson, Cruz, or 
		    somebody equally weak tries to step in and take over the cult, it could spell 
			doom for the GOP for a generation.</p>

          <p>So get out the popcorn, but maybe you should also have something a little 
		    more defensive than that. Get ready. It’s gonna be a rough ride, but in all 
			probability we’ll make it through without the kind of damage that Germany or 
			the people at Jonestown suffered.</p>

          <p>Wish us all luck. We need it — and citizen activism — now more than ever 
		    before.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">How the GOP Turned America Into a Powder Keg, and Is 
		    About to Light the Match. Housing bubbles, financial scams, and political 
			sabotage are converging into a historic, preventable disaster.</p>

          <p>Republicans may be fixing to crash the economy again — Republican presidents 
		    oversaw 10 of the last 11 recessions and the Republican Great Depression — and 
			they’re doing it to satisfy the greed of the billionaires they serve.</p>

          <p>Today, for example, is the day that some of Trump‘s worst tariffs are supposed 
		    to go into effect, and many folks on Wall Street are deciding where they want 
			to hide when the ceiling starts falling in. The horrible jobs report just 
			released hours ago highlights not only how bad things were in July, but they 
			had to “revise downward by 285,000 jobs” previous reports; it looks like Trump’s 
			people have been cooking the books.</p>

          <p>The Financial Times is on it; they published an article this week titled, 
		    “The US economy is more fragile than it appears.” It’s author, Tej Parikh, 
			points out that our housing market is in trouble and starting to look like it 
			did around the time of the Bush Housing Crash in 2008, that spending patterns 
			are changing in alarming ways (my phrase, not his), and that both the labor 
			and stock markets are vulnerable. The article is frankly alarming.</p>

          <p>And former labor secretary Robert Reich titled his brilliant newsletter 
		    yesterday: “Be Warned: The Financial Bubble Will Soon Burst.” The former 
			Clinton cabinet member writes:</p>

          <p>“The financial economy — stocks, bonds, and their derivatives — is in for a 
		    big reality check, and I think it will happen soon.”</p>

          <p>“The financial economy — stocks, bonds, and their derivatives — is in for a 
		    big reality America has stared into this abyss before; three times, in fact. 
			In the 1770s, a brutal financial crisis driven by colonial overextension, 
			monopolistic control by the British East India Company, and political 
			corruption helped spark the American Revolution. In the 1850s, it was 
			wildcat banking, land speculation, and a collapse in trust that helped 
			produce the Panic of 1857 and push the nation toward civil war. And in 1929, 
			Republican deregulation, tax cuts for the rich, financial speculation, and 
			an all-out assault on labor exploded into the Republican Great Depression.</p>

          <p>“The financial economy — stocks, bonds, and their derivatives — is in for a 
		    big reality Today, every one of the fuse lines that set off those explosions 
			is once again being laid by a Republican president and Party that has abandoned 
			any pretense of economic stewardship or patriotism.</p>

          <p>“The financial economy — stocks, bonds, and their derivatives — is in for a 
		    big reality They are actively destabilizing the pillars of our economy, 
			undermining our democracy, and gutting the social contract that held us 
			together for nearly a century. And unless we act — forcefully, quickly, and 
			collectively — we may soon experience a collapse that makes 2008 look like a 
			speed bump.</p>

		    big reality The risk of a modern economic depression is not academic or merely 
			theoretical. It’s also not fearmongering. It is real, it is avoidable, and it 
			is being amplified by a political movement that openly disdains regulation, 
			despises democracy, and seeks to roll back every gain the American middle 
			class has made since FDR dragged this country out of the last Republican-
			created catastrophe.</p>

          <dl>
            <dt>We are now living under a Republican president whose party has:</dt>
            <dd>Repeatedly held the full faith and credit of the United States hostage in 
			  debt ceiling standoffs designed to force cruel cuts to programs that serve 
			  ordinary people;</dd>
            <dd>Demanded the Fed lower interest rates in a way that could push the nation 
			  into an inflationary spiral even as wages stagnate and housing becomes 
			  unaffordable for the bottom 90%;</dd>
            <dd>Pushed for the end of regulations on banks, fossil fuel companies, tech 
			  monopolies, and Wall Street speculators, even as their recklessness increases 
			  systemic risk;</dd>
            <dd>Championed massive tax cuts for billionaires and multinational corporations, 
			  ballooning the deficit while cutting benefits and raising taxes on working 
			  people;</dd>
            <dd>Enabled trade wars and supply chain disruptions while cutting support for green 
              manufacturing and public investment;</dd>
            <dd>Promoted and made billions from crypto;</dd>
            <dd>And perhaps most grotesquely, embraced open authoritarianism and white 
			  nationalism, eroding the rule of law and the very stability on which economic 
			  confidence depends.</dd>
          </dl>
          <p>Every one of these moves destabilizes the foundation of modern prosperity. 
		    And every one of them echoes the warning signs of past collapses. The mechanisms 
			of economic catastrophe are not mysterious. We’ve seen them before.</p>

          <p>Start with sovereign debt and fiscal dysfunction.</p>

          <p>In 2023 and 2024, House Republicans repeatedly brought us to the brink of 
		    default just to slash food aid, gut Medicaid, and kill green jobs. Now, in 
			2025, they’re salivating over a new “Balanced Budget Amendment” that would 
			make countercyclical investment during recessions illegal. That’s economic 
			suicide.</p>

          <p>When demand collapses, the government must spend to stabilize the system. 
		    That’s Econ 101. But the GOP wants a permanent austerity straitjacket. Why? 
			Because billionaires don’t suffer in recessions: they buy everything at a 
			discount and radically increase their own wealth when things rebound. For 
			the morbidly rich, Republican recessions and depressions are “buying 
			opportunities”: it’s class war, plain and simple.</p>

            <dt><b>We’re once again living in an era of rampant unregulated financial engineering:</b></dt>
            <dd>Crypto Ponzi schemes.</dd>
            <dd>AI stock frenzies.</dd>
            <dd>Private equity gutting essential companies and loading them with debt.</dd>
            <dd>Trillions of dollars sloshing around the system chasing yield, while

			  wing ideologues.</dd>
          </dl>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Remember what happened in 1929? The same “let the 
		    market police itself” ideology brought the whole thing crashing down. The 
			difference now is that the contagion would be global and could even be 
			instantaneous.</p>
          <p>Trade shocks and de-dollarization are looming risks, too.</p>
          <p>Trump’s tariffs hurt American farmers and manufacturers. His talk of a new 
		    10% universal tariff could ignite a global trade war and could push countries 
			like China, Brazil, or Saudi Arabia to finally abandon the dollar as the 
			reserve currency.</p>
          <p>If that happens — if Treasury bonds stop being the world’s safe haven — we’re 
		    looking at a collapse in our ability to finance debt, a surge in interest 
			rates, a crash in the housing market, and mass layoffs. And the Republicans? 
			They cheer it on. They think chaos is good politics.</p>
          <p>And then there are tariffs: there’s a reason the Founders of this country and 
		    Framers of the Constitution gave the power to enact tariffs exclusively to 
			Congress. They knew that nobody would build a factory here unless they knew 
			that a tariff defending their manufacturing would be in place for the decades 
			it would take to recover their investment costs.</p>
          <p>When tariffs are simply slapped here and there willy-nilly by a single man 
		    and can be easily repealed by the next president, no competent business manager 
			would take them seriously: the only thing tariffs do, under these circumstances, 
			is damage the economy. Meanwhile, Trump’s tariffs so far are going to cost the 
			average American family $2,400 this year.</p>

          <p>And, from Donald Trump’s point of view, they force foreign leaders to come 
		    grovel in front of him, which absolutely delights him. He brags about it, 
			once noting that, “They are kissing my ass.” This is not trade policy; he’s 
			just doing this for his ego.</p>

          <p>And what about public confidence and how the loss of it could cause a depression?</p>

          <p>You can’t have a functioning economy without trust in government, in institutions, 
		    in money itself. But the GOP has made destroying trust its central project.</p>

          <p>They lie about elections. They undermine the courts. They spread conspiracy 
		    theories. They smear career civil servants. They openly praise authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>When half the population no longer believes in the legitimacy of its own 
		    government, and when the other half sees that government captured by billionaires 
			and zealots, economic confidence evaporates.</p>

          <p>People stop spending. They stop investing. They retreat into cash and hoarding. 
		    That’s how depressions spiral out of control.</p>

          <p>Now layer on climate instability and its ability to wreck an economy and you 
		    have a real mess.</p>

          <p>The GOP’s climate denialism is not just immoral, it’s economically suicidal. 
		    Hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and heat waves are destroying billions in 
			assets every year.</p>

          <p>Insurance markets are collapsing in California, Florida, and Louisiana. 
		    Agricultural yields are falling. Water shortages are hitting the Southwest. 
			Floods are wiping out the Midwest and the South while wildfires torch the 
			West. But Republicans keep slashing climate research, killing green energy 
			subsidies, and banning ESG investment strategies. They are literally outlawing 
			the future.</p>

          <p>It’s a five-alarm fire, and the Republican arsonists are demanding more 
		    gasoline.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There is, however, a way out. We’ve done it before.</p>
          <p>After the last Republican-created depression, Franklin Roosevelt rejected 
		    the dogma of austerity and implemented the most ambitious suite of Keynesian 
			policies in world history. He put people to work. He regulated the banks. He 
			taxed the rich. He unionized the workforce. He broke up monopolies. He guaranteed 
			Social Security, unemployment insurance, and the right to organize.</p>
          <p>That system — Keynesian demand-side economics — created the greatest middle 
		    class the world has ever seen. It lifted millions out of poverty, stabilized 
			capitalism, and gave rise to the postwar economic boom. It literally created 
			the modern American middle class.</p>
          <p>But starting in 1981, Reagan and the GOP declared war on that system. They 
		    gutted antitrust enforcement. They slashed top tax rates. They crushed unions. 
			They deregulated finance. They privatized public goods. They shifted the burden 
			of funding government from the rich to the working class. And then they blamed 
			the victims of their policies for the resulting inequality and instability.</p>
          <p>Now they’re going for the kill shot.</p>
          <p>Trump and his Republican Party are not just misguided; they are dangerous. 
		    Their policies are not just bad; they are existential threats to economic 
			stability. They’ve created the conditions for collapse, and they’ll blame 
			immigrants, Democrats, or queer kids when it happens.</p>
          <p>We can’t let them. We have to take our country back, economically, politically, morally.</p>
          <p>That means rejecting trickle-down nonsense and restoring Keynesian demand-side 
            policies. It means breaking up monopolies and rebuilding a regulatory state that
            works. It means bringing back progressive taxation and closing loopholes for 
            billionaires. It means massive investment in clean energy, public health, 
            education, and infrastructure. It means rebuilding trust in democracy by 
            reversing Citizens United, defending voting rights, rooting out corruption, 
            and calling out fascism where we see it.</p>
          <p>This must be at the core of the platform Democrats run on this fall and during next 
            year’s midterms.</p>
          <p>The risk of a depression is real. But the solution is in our hands. We just have to stop 
            letting the Republican Party light the matches.</p>
