Why public schools are on the GOP’s hit list
The founders of our nation well understood the importance of universal quality public 
education. The first law mandating public schools paid for with taxpayer dollars was 
passed in Massachusetts in 1647: to this day, that state is notable for its historic 
emphasis on education.[lxix]

As Thomas Jefferson, who founded America’s first tuition-free public college (the 
University of Virginia), noted in a letter to Colonel Charles Yancey on January 6, 
1816:

“If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects 
what never was and never will be.”

The American president who immediately preceded him, our second, John Adams, also 
weighed in on the importance of public education in a letter to his old friend John 
Jebb when, in 1785, Adams was serving in London as America’s first Minister to Great 
Britain.

He’d seen the consequences of poverty and illiteracy in both the US and England and was 
horrified:

“The social science will never be much improved, until the people unanimously know and 
consider themselves as the fountain of power, and until they shall know how to manage 
it wisely and honestly. Reformation must begin with the body of the people, which can 
be done only, to effect, in their educations.

“The whole people must take upon themselves the education of the whole people, and must 
be willing to bear the expenses of it. There should not be a district of one mile 
square, without a school in it, not founded by a charitable individual, but maintained 
at the expense of the people themselves.”[lxx]

Nonetheless, former Tea Party congressman and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently 
put a bulls-eye on the back of the president of the 1.7 million-member American 
Federation of Teachers.

“I tell the story often — I get asked ‘Who’s the most dangerous person in the world? Is 
it Chairman Kim, is it Xi Jinping?’” Pompeo told Semafor’s Shelby Talcott.[lxxi]

“The most dangerous person in the world is Randi Weingarten. It’s not a close call. If 
you ask, ‘Who’s the most likely to take this republic down?’ It would be the teacher’s 
unions, and the filth that they’re teaching our kids…”

Louise and I have known, respected, and admired Randi for years and she’s been a 
frequent guest on my program: her number one interest is providing the highest 
quality education to as many American children as possible. Full stop.

So why would Pompeo, then pursuing the 2024 Republican nomination for president, 
risk triggering an American domestic terrorist to train his sites on her? Why would 
an educated man have such antipathy toward public school teachers?

Public schools are on the GOP’s hit list, just as they were in Chile during the 
Pinochet regime, and for the same reasons:[lxxii]

— Fascism flourishes when people are ignorant.

— Private for-profit schools are an efficient way to transfer billions from tax revenues 
into the coffers of “education entrepreneurs” who then recycle that money into 
Republican political campaigns (just like they’ve done with private for-profit 
prisons).

— Private schools are most likely to be segregated by race and class, which appeals 
to the bigoted base of the Republican party.

— Most public school teachers are unionized, and the GOP hates unions.

— While public school boards are our most basic and vigorous form of democracy, 
private schools are generally unaccountable to the public.

— Whitewashing America’s racial and genocidal history while ignoring the struggles 
of women and queer folk further empowers straight white male supremacy.

— Nothing inspires fear and terror in the minds of parents than a threat to their 
children, and the GOP — being totally committed to enriching the rich and 
impoverishing everybody else — has nothing else to sell than fear and hate to win 
elections. (See item #1: fascism.)

Author Umberto Eco, who had a ringside seat to the rise of Italian dictator Benito 
Mussolini in the 1920s, noted in his “14 indicators of fascism” that dumbing down the 
populace by lowering educational standards was critical to producing a compliant 
populace a fascist leader could easily manipulate.

“All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks,” he wrote, “made use of an impoverished vocabulary, 
and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical 
reasoning.”[lxxiii]

Ironically, this very use of public schools to promote a political agenda was the 
foundation David Koch cited when, in 1980, the billionaire conservative activist 
attacked American public schools during his run for Vice President on the Libertarian 
Party ticket.

“We condemn compulsory education laws … and we call for the immediate repeal of such 
laws,” proclaimed his platform. “We advocate the complete separation of education and 
State. Government schools lead to the indoctrination of children and interfere with 
the free choice of individuals. Government ownership, operation, regulation, and 
subsidy of schools and colleges should be ended.”[lxxiv]

But the United States spends almost a trillion dollars a year on primary school education, 
an expense category just below healthcare and even more than the Pentagon budget: there 
are massive profits to be made if privatized entities can skim even a few percent off 
the top.[lxxv]

Those profits, in turn, can be used — with the Supreme Court’s blessing — to legally 
bribe elected officials to further gut public schools and transfer even more of our 
tax dollars to private schools and their stockholders.

This pursuit of America’s education dollars is nothing new. The first American president 
to put an anti-public-schools crusader in charge of the Education Department was Ronald 
Reagan.

At the time, our public schools were the envy of the world and had recently raised up a 
generation of scientists and innovators that brought us everything from the transistor 
to Velcro to putting men on the moon.

Reagan’s Education Secretary Bill Bennett is probably most famous for having claimed 
that, “You could abort every Black baby in this country, and your crime rate would go 
down.” And then aggressively standing behind his quote in repeated media 
appearances.[lxxvi] [lxxvii]

Reagan and Bennett oversaw the gutting of Federal support for civics education, cutting 
the nation’s federal education budget by 18.5%.

As a result, the group that runs national exams of eighth graders across the country, 
the National Assessment of Educational Progress, determined in 2018 that only 24% of 
US students were “proficient in civics.”[lxxviii] It’s gotten so bad that the Lincoln 
Project, a pro-democracy PAC, is launching a K-12 civics program of their own called 
the Franklin Project.[lxxix]

George W. Bush continued the GOP tradition, proposing an 8% cut to education and 
welfare budgets.[lxxx]

After initiating the privatization of Medicare in 2003 with the Medicare Advantage 
scam (a model for privatizing education), his Education Secretary, Rod Paige, called 
the nation’s largest teacher’s union, the National Education Association, a “terrorist 
organization.”[lxxxi]

Sixteen years later, Donald Trump and his Education Secretary Betsy DeVos then proposed 
cutting 12% or $8.5 billion out of the federal education budget, while allocating over 
$5 billion in taxpayer dollars to flow into the money bins of their private school 
cronies.[lxxxii]

I mentioned Pompeo’s essentially calling Randi Weingarten a terrorist. Unions as 
saboteurs is a viewpoint widely held across the Republican Party and among 
rightwing billionaires.

But it’s simply not true: teachers’ unions have been a primary force in improving the 
quality of American education for almost a century.

Eunice S. Han is an economics professor and researcher at the University of Utah, and 
formerly was with Wellesley College. She did exhaustive research into the impact of 
teachers’ unions on teacher quality and educational outcomes: it’s the single-most 
definitive study done on the subject to date.[lxxxiii]

Her findings were unambiguous and rebut the GOP’s talking point that teachers’ unions 
“protect bad teachers”:

“[T]eachers unions, by negotiating higher wages for teachers, lower the quit probability 
of high-ability teachers but raise the dismissal rate of underperforming teachers, as 
higher wages provide districts greater incentive to select better teachers.”[lxxxiv]

Looking at the most comprehensive set of national data available on teacher quality 
and educational outcome from “the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES): 
the School and Staffing Survey (SASS) for three waves (2003-2004, 2007- 2008, and 
2011-2012), its supplement Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS) for each wave of the SASS, 
and the School Districts Finance Survey (SDFS),” she found:

“The data confirms that, compared to districts with weak unionism, districts with strong 
unionism dismiss more low-quality teachers and retain more high-quality teachers. The 
empirical analysis shows that this dynamic of teacher turnover in highly unionized 
districts raises average teacher quality and improves student achievement.”[lxxxv]

But don’t bother trying to tell that to Republicans: they know that unions are 
terrorists, or at least give nightmares to bad bosses and poorly run businesses that 
exploit their workers. As Betsy DeVos told an ALEC meeting of Republican state 
legislators and corporate lobbyists in July, 2017:

“They’ve made it clear that they care more about a system, one created in the 1800s, 
than they do about individual students.”[lxxxvi]

In other words, “Don’t bother me with facts.”

John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were right about public education, and privatizing it 
is as much a crime against the commons and our democracy as was privatizing our 
prisons, over half the Pentagon budget, and Medicare.

Rightwing billionaires are now funding Astroturf “Liberty” and “Freedom” groups to 
attack and take over public school boards, seeking to ghettoize their schools, drive 
out unionized teachers, and impose a gender-bigoted, white supremacist, and anti-
science curriculum. (Only 40% of our schools today even teach evolution, as that’s 
become so “controversial” again.)[lxxxvii]

Of all our democratic institutions, from Congress to state houses to city councils, 
the most on-the-ground, closest-to-the-people are school boards.

They’re the most vibrant and often most important of our governmental bodies, designed 
to express and facilitate the will of local parents and voters. And a great springboard 
to other elected offices: many members of Congress began their political careers running 
for a school board.

Private schools, of course, don’t have school boards. They’re accountable to their 
shareholders and CEOs.

Steve Bannon and other rightwing personalities have, for the past several years as part 
of their effort to destroy public education, been aggressively encouraging their 
followers to run for public school boards and, where they don’t win, show up at 
every meeting to make their members lives miserable.

It’s an area where Democrats and progressives have dropped the ball, big time.

If you’re a parent or grandparent, or even just a concerned citizen, there is no 
better or more crucial time to show up at your local school board than now. And 
bring your friends and neighbors with you.
