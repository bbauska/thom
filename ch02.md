“Necessitous men are not free men”
Most Americans, even today, would tell you that being in the middle class enhances their 
sense of freedom and liberty, even though they don’t realize that a middle class is not 
a normal thing for capitalist societies.

But the simple reality is that middle classes must be created, and that requires 
government intervention in the marketplace and government guarantees of some services 
that otherwise aren’t available to average working people (like free roads, public 
schools, and the ability to join a union).

During the era from 1933 to 1980, Americans held a very specific view of “freedom” 
and “liberty.” Both were recognized as explicit by-products of government providing a 
foundation for family life and a fertile soil of financial, legal, and physical 
infrastructure in which business could root itself.

The foundation for a freedom-based family life was accomplished by laws and regulations 
that prevented corporate exploitation of workers, free public schools and near-free 
college, and widespread access to inexpensive healthcare.

The needs of business promoted by the construction of infrastructure that business could 
use to deliver products to market (railroads, highways, airports) and clear, specific 
rules and regulations of business activity to, as much as was both possible and 
reasonable, give even small and new businesses an opportunity to grow and thrive.

FDR himself outlined this in his 1944 fireside chat on “the state of the union”:

<blockquote>
“We have come to a clear realization of the fact, however, that true individual freedom 
cannot exist without economic security and independence. Necessitous men are not free 
men. People who are hungry, people who are out of a job are the stuff of which 
dictatorships are made.

“In our day these economic truths have become accepted as self-evident. We have 
accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights under which a new basis of security 
and prosperity can be established for all — regardless of station, or race or creed.”[xxxiii]
</blockquote>

Republicans (with the exception of President Dwight Eisenhower, who the John Birch 
Society famously called a communist[xxxiv]) broadly rejected FDR’s definitions of 
freedom and liberty, arguing instead that the words meant an absence of government 
“intrusion” into individual and corporate life.

They’ve been trying to undo or reverse FDR’s New Deal ever since it was put into place in 
the 1930s, including campaigning for privatizing everything from Social Security to the 
national highway system.[xxxv] [xxxvi]

When FDR came into office in 1933, only 12 percent of Americans were in the middle class 
and, as noted earlier, most were professional people like doctors and lawyers.[xxxvii]

By 1980, fully two-thirds of American families were middle class — with a single income 
— because about a third of American workers were unionized and those union contracts set 
the local wage and benefits floors for another third of non-union employers and workers.

Thus, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president, he kicked off the country’s 
longest (48 years) second progressive era bringing back high taxes on the rich, putting 
the right to unionize into law, and building the largest and wealthiest middle class in 
world history.
