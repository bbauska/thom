          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Although both presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald 
		    Reagan quoted Puritan leader John Winthrop’s 1630 “city on a hill” speech 
			(Reagan added the word “shining”) when referencing our land of opportunity, 
			the expression “American Dream” originates with historian James Truslow Adams 
			and his 1931 book The Epic of America.[xix] He describes “that dream of a land 
			in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with 
			opportunity for each according to ability or achievement.”</p>
          <p>He was expressing a sentiment held by most of the Founders of this country 
		    and the Framers of the Constitution, as well as foreign observers and leading 
			American philosophers throughout history. Alexis de Tocqueville in the 1830s 
			called it “the charm of anticipated success.” Henry David Thoreau, in Walden, 
			wrote in 1854: “If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, 
			and endeavors to live the life he has imagined, he will meet with a success 
			unexpected in common hours.”[xx]</p>
          <p>The phrase “American dream” was first used widely during the Progressive Era 
		    (1888-1920) and originally meant something quite different from today: it meant 
			justice, equality, and democracy during a time when the nation was run by 
			oligarchs, politicians were bought-off (so much so that states added ballot 
			initiatives to their constitutions to get around the problem), and workers 
			were routinely murdered for wanting to unionize.</p>
          <p>In this context, “the American dream” began to appear in newspaper articles and books; 
		    arguably President Grover Cleveland was referring to it when he gave his second State 
			of the Union speech in 1888 and said:</p>
          <blockquote>
			“We discover that the fortunes realized by our manufacturers are no longer solely the 
			reward of sturdy industry and enlightened foresight, but that they result from the 
			discriminating favor of the Government and are largely built upon undue exactions from 
			the masses of our people. The gulf between employers and the employed is constantly 
			widening, and classes are rapidly forming, one comprising the very rich and powerful, 
			while in another are found the toiling poor.
			“As we view the achievements of aggregated capital, we discover the existence of trusts, 
			combinations, and monopolies, while the citizen is struggling far in the rear or is 
			trampled to death beneath an iron heel. Corporations, which should be the carefully 
			restrained creatures of the law and the servants of the people, are fast becoming the 
			people's masters.”[xxi]
		  </blockquote>
		  <p>But the expression became cemented in the American vernacular in 1931 with JT Adams’ 
		    book, although at the time many were doubtful; it was the depth of the Republican Great 
			Depression. As FDR put America back together and created the nation’s first comprehensive 
			social safety net, the idea began to acquire its modern context of American government 
			providing the fertile soil for people to achieve their personal “dream.”</p>
          <p>Prior to the full enactment of Progressive Era and New Deal reforms, the American middle 
		    class was relatively small and mostly limited to professionals like physicians, attorneys, 
			and those in business management.</p>
          <p>We practiced largely unregulated capitalism until the 1930s, and the tiny class of 
		    morbidly rich people (that unregulated capitalism always produces) largely controlled 
			our political system through most of our nation’s history, particularly from the early 
			Industrial Revolution 1870s through the 1930s when President Franklin Roosevelt directly 
			challenged those who he called the “Economic Royalists.”[xxii]</p>
          <p>As recently as 1900, for example, poverty stalked America and farmers were at the mercy 
		    of the weather. There was no minimum wage; when workers tried to organize unions police 
			would help employers beat or even murder their ringleaders; and social safety net 
			programs like unemployment insurance, Social Security, Medicare, food and housing 
			supports, and Medicaid didn’t exist.</p>
          <p>There was no income tax to pay for such programs, and federal receipts were a mere 3 
		    percent of GDP (today they’re around 20 percent[xxiii]).  As the President’s Council of 
			Economic Advisors noted in their 2000 Annual Report:</p>
          <blockquote>
			“To appreciate how far we have come, it is instructive to look back on what American life 
			was like in 1900. At the turn of the century, fewer than 10 percent of homes had 
			electricity, and fewer than 2 percent of people had telephones. An automobile was a 
			luxury that only the very wealthy could afford.
			“Many women still sewed their own clothes and gave birth at home. Because chlorination 
			had not yet been introduced and water filtration was rare, typhoid fever, spread by 
			contaminated water, was a common affliction. One in 10 children died in infancy. 
			Average life expectancy was a mere 47 years.
			“Fewer than 14 percent of Americans graduated from high school. ... Widowhood was far 
			more common than divorce [because of the dire economic consequences to women of 
			divorce]. The average household had close to five members, and a fifth of all households 
			had seven or more. …
			“Average income per capita, in 1999 dollars, was about $4,200. … The typical workweek in 
			manufacturing was about 50 hours, 20 percent longer than the average today.”[xxiv]
			</blockquote>
		  <p>The Progressive Era laid the groundwork for President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, 
		    which he rolled out after his inauguration in March 1933. The major pre-FDR Progressive 
			Era accomplishments included:</p>
          <p>— The 16th Amendment (1913) established the ability of Congress to create and levy a tax 
		    on personal income and corporate profits. Prior to that, most government functions were 
			funded by tariffs on foreign goods, which paid for almost all federal functions from the 
			George Washington to the Abraham Lincoln administrations, about two-thirds of government 
			from Lincoln to Wilson, and about a third of government until the mid-20th century as 
			“free trade” collapsed tariffs while leading to an explosion of foreign-made goods in 
			American stores.[xxv] Lacking the revenue from an income tax served as a limit on the 
			size and functions of the federal government; the passage of the 16th Amendment set the 
			stage for the New Deal and subsequent expansion of federal programs to this day.</p>
          <p>- The 17th Amendment (1913) ended the practice of state governments appointing US 
		    senators and turned that choice over to each state’s voters. Prior to that, wealthy 
			people and big businesses would make sure their choice of senators were put into office 
			by essentially bribing state legislators and governors. The event that most conspicuously 
			led to the 17th Amendment was when William Clark, a Montana copper baron and one of 
			America’s richest men, reportedly stood outside the doors of the Montana legislature in 
			1898 as they voted on that state’s next US senator. Clark, the story goes, had a 
			pocketful of white envelopes in his jacket pocket, each containing a crisp new $1000 
			bill, which he passed out to each legislator who’d voted for him as they left the 
			chamber. The national outrage was so severe that the Senate first refused to seat Clark, 
			then forced his resignation in 1899 with a motion to void his position. Montana’s 
			legislators, not forgetting his great wealth and many favors, returned him to the US 
			Senate in 1900, where he served from 1901 until 1907.[xxvi]</p>
		  <p>— The 19th Amendment (1920) nationally enfranchised women. This amendment to give women 
		    the right to vote across the country was written by Susan B. Anthony, and passed both 
			the House and Senate in 1878, with Wisconsin and Illinois being the first states to 
			ratify it. It failed to reach the threshold of three-quarters of the states, however, 
			until 1919 and was certified and put into law on August 26, 1920. The first state to 
			enfranchise women was Wyoming, which, in 1869, passed a law allowing women to vote, 
			own and inherit property, have legal custody of their own children, and hold public 
			office.[xxvii] That was, not coincidentally, the year that Susan B. Anthony and 
			Elizabeth Cady Stanton established the National Woman’s Suffrage Association.[xxviii]</p>
		  <p>— The Sherman Anti-Trust Act (1890)[xxix] and the Clayton Antitrust Act (1914)[xxx], 
		    both designed to stop and unwind the excesses of the morbidly rich and the giant 
			corporations they controlled.</p>
		  <p>— Both federal and state-by-state legislation regulating working hours and conditions, 
		    improving sanitary living conditions and open spaces in big cities, and protecting 
			consumers from fraud and hustlers.</p>
		  <p>The Progressive Era came to an end with the election of conservative Republican Warren 
		    Harding in 1920. Harding campaigned on two major slogans: “A return to normalcy”[xxxi] 
			and “Less government in business and more business in government.”[xxxii]  The 
			“normalcy” slogan was a promise to drop President Woodrow Wilson’s 91 percent top 
			income tax bracket down to 25 percent, and the second slogan essentially meant 
			“privatize and deregulate.” </p>
          <p>Harding did all three, causing (through his, Coolidge’s, and Hoover’s Republican 
		    administrations between 1921-1932) an explosion in the stock market creating 
			“Roaring 20’s” piles of cash for the very, very rich while crushing unions and 
			driving down working-class wages. </p>
          <p>Harding’s conservative era ended abruptly when his deregulation of the banking and 
 		    securities industries led straight to the stock market crash of 1929 and what was 
		    then called the Republican Great Depression.</p>
